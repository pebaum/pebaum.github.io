# FORWARD — RULES v2.1 (Diamond Path Edition)

A solo roguelike card adventure about choosing what you’ll face and what you’ll leave behind.

================================================================================
0) OVERVIEW & OBJECTIVE
================================================================================
The world has thinned to nine haunted places. Your father—the Mirror Knight—
challenged the Dragon of Chaos and failed. You will cross each place in turn,
gather what you can, and finally confront the Dragon.

You win if you defeat the Dragon after completing the 9th location.
You lose if your HP reaches 0 (or a card effect ends the game).

================================================================================
1) CONTENTS
================================================================================
• Forward Deck (100+ total): 9 Location cards and their encounter cards
  (items, equipment, allies, scenes, hazards, combats, etc.).
• Resolve card and Dread card (used together as the Resolve/Dread Track).
• Player card, markers/tokens, and any reference cards.
• Optional piles: BURIED (global, face-down).

================================================================================
2) QUICKSTART (TEACH BOX)
================================================================================
1. Lay out the Diamond Path of nine Location stacks (Fig. 1).
2. Build the Resolve/Dread Track with a marker in the neutral gap.
3. Take Location L1 into play (Fig. 2). Draw 3 cards face-down to the Active row.
4. On your turn, reveal and resolve one Active card (your choice).
   • Keepers (items/equipment/companions/boons) go to your Player Zone.
   • Others go to the Discard (or BURIED if instructed).
   • Refill the Active row back to 3 while the deck has cards.
5. When the deck and Active row are empty, cap the discard with the Location card
   and set that stack aside, out of play.
6. Choose the next Location from the Diamond and repeat until you face the Dragon.

================================================================================
3) TABLE LAYOUT & FLOW
================================================================================
3.1 FIG. 1 — Diamond Path (nine Location stacks)

                [L9]
            [L7]   [L8]
        [L4]   [L5]   [L6]
            [L2]   [L3]
                [L1]

• Each [L#] is a Location stack: face-up Location card on top; that location’s
  shuffled, face-down deck underneath it.
• The labels L1 → L9 show the order you plan to tackle them (e.g., L1 = Home Village Termina).
• A Location stack always travels together.

3.2 Resolve / Dread Track (two-card slider)
• Place Resolve on top of Dread, offset so a slim neutral gap is visible between
  them. Put one marker in the neutral gap to start.
• Each card shows 4 steps/bands.
• Gain N Resolve → move the marker up N steps toward the Resolve card.
• Gain N Dread   → move the marker down N steps toward the Dread card.
• The marker is capped at the ends (cannot go beyond the 4th band).
• Cards may check thresholds like “if Resolve ≥ 2” or “if Dread ≥ 3.”
  Count steps outward from the neutral gap.
• The track persists between locations unless a card says otherwise.

3.3 FIG. 2 — Active Location (play space for the chosen stack)

[Active Location card]     ← face-up reference/title/art

[Location Deck ↓]   [Discard]     ← deck face-down; discard starts empty

Active row (face-down, up to three):
[?]   [?]   [?]

================================================================================
4) SETUP
================================================================================
1) Select the nine Locations for this run and arrange them as the Diamond Path.
2) For each Location: Location card face-up, its own shuffled deck face-down under it.
3) Set your Player Zone nearby (HP marker, inventory limits, companions, etc.).
4) Place Resolve over Dread to form the Track; start with the marker in the neutral gap.
5) Reserve a space for BURIED (a global face-down pile for “bury” effects).

================================================================================
5) LOCATION SEQUENCE & TURN STRUCTURE
================================================================================
5.1 Begin a Location
• Remove the chosen Location stack (e.g., L1) from the Diamond and build the
  Active Location area (Fig. 2).
• Draw three cards face-down into the Active row.

5.2 Your Turn (inside a Location)
On your turn, perform the following; if a card contradicts these rules, follow the card.
1) Choose one face-down Active card. Reveal it.
2) Resolve its text completely.
   – If it stays with you (Item/Equipment/Companion/Boon), place it in your Player Zone
     (respect limits printed on your Player card or the card itself).
   – If it's a Snare, leave it in your Player Zone or a dedicated Snare area (see 9.1). It remains until cleansed or otherwise removed.
   – If it does not stay, place it on the Discard.
   – If it says bury, place it face-down in the global BURIED pile.
   – If it references Resolve/Dread, move your marker accordingly.
3) Refill the Active row back to three face-down cards if the deck still has cards.
4) Effects may let you peek, reorder, scry, fish, or otherwise manipulate the deck or row.

Rules notes
• “Active cards” are only the face-down cards in the row. Once revealed and resolved,
  they move to your Player Zone, the Discard, or BURIED as instructed.
• If a draw/refill step is required but the deck is empty, skip that step.

5.3 Finishing a Location
• When both the Location deck is empty and the Active row has no cards left:
  1) Place the Location card on top of the Discard pile (capping it).
  2) Move the capped stack aside, out of play.
  3) Choose your next Location from the Diamond and rebuild the Active Location area.

================================================================================
6) CARD TYPES (REFERENCE)
================================================================================
• Item / Equipment / Boon — Kept in your Player Zone; may grant stats, uses, or text effects.
• Companion / Ally — Kept in your Player Zone; abilities or single-use powers.
• Scene / Rest — Immediate effects; usually go to Discard after resolving.
• Hazard / Pit / Snare / Challenge — Tests that can cost HP, cards, Resolve, time, etc. Revealed Snares stay in your Player Zone until cleansed (see 9.1).
• Combat / Beast / Hollow — Fights using the Duel System (Section 7).
• Treasure / Reward / Blessing — Immediate benefits or persistent keepers.
• Terror — Hard choices or escalating pressure (often interacts with Dread).
• Bury — Send the card face-down to the BURIED pile (not the Discard) unless told otherwise.

If a card’s type and its rules ever disagree, the rules text wins.

================================================================================
7) DUEL SYSTEM (COMBAT)
================================================================================
When you enter Combat, both you and the enemy roll 1d6 simultaneously and apply results.
Reduce damage you take by your [DEF]. Add [ATK] to your damage where noted.

Player faces
1 — MISS: Deal 0.
2 — PARRY: Block all incoming.
3 — HIT: Deal 1 + [ATK].
4 — HIT: Deal 1 + [ATK].
5 — CRITICAL: Deal 2 + [ATK].
6 — COUNTER: Block all incoming and deal 1 (unless enemy text overrides).

Enemy text defines its HP, faces, immunities, and on-hit effects. Apply all text.
If both sides would block and deal damage, apply blocks first, then any damage that remains.
If either side hits 0 HP, that side is defeated immediately.

================================================================================
8) RESOLVE & DREAD (DETAIL)
================================================================================
Resolve represents courage/clarity/momentum. Dread represents fear/confusion/weight.
• Start with the marker in the neutral gap between the two cards.
• Gain/Spend Resolve or Gain Dread as instructed by cards; move the marker up/down.
• Many cards check thresholds like “if Resolve ≥ 2” or “if Dread ≥ 3.”
• Unless a card says otherwise, your current step on the track persists between locations.

Designer intent: the Track is a shared scalar resource that cards read from or modify.
High Resolve and high Dread effects live on the cards themselves.

================================================================================
9) PLAYER ZONE & LIMITS
================================================================================
• Keep Items/Equipment/Companions/Boons here.
• If a limit is exceeded, immediately discard or bury down to the limit, as directed
  by your Player card or the exceeding card’s text.
• Spent or broken cards will say how and when they leave play.

9.1 Snares
• When revealed, a Snare stays face-up in your Player Zone or a dedicated Snare area until cleansed or otherwise removed.
• Effects that say “Cleanse 1 Snare” let you choose one of your revealed Snares. Discard it and ignore its ongoing effects.

================================================================================
10) RESTS, SCENES, & CHECKPOINTS
================================================================================
Some cards instruct you to rest, recover, or bank progress (heal, reduce Dread,
stash items, etc.). Resolve exactly as written; most go to Discard after use.

================================================================================
11) THE DRAGON OF CHAOS (FINAL FIGHT)
================================================================================
After completing the 9th Location, assemble the Dragon and follow its card(s):
• Use the Duel System with the Dragon’s special faces and seals/immunities as printed.
• You may carry everything in your Player Zone into the battle unless told otherwise.
• If the Dragon’s HP drops to 0, you win. If your HP reaches 0, you lose.

If your set uses Seals/Boons tied to the Sage, Ghostly Princess, or Mirror Knight,
follow those card rules when instructed.

================================================================================
12) EDGE CASES & PRIORITY
================================================================================
• Card text > This rulebook when they conflict.
• If an instruction can’t be completed, do as much as possible and ignore the rest.
• “Draw” from a Location means from its face-down Location deck unless explicitly
  told to draw from elsewhere.
• If a pile is empty when you must draw/refill, skip that step.

================================================================================
