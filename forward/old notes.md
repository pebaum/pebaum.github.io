5.12 ideas for tarot style exploration
- Shuffle dungeon tiles; place the start tile first and the end tile last.
- Tiles have directional doorways and contain a room type (treasure, event, encounter, trap, etc.).
- When entering a room, draw a random card of the matching type to populate it.
- Without vision items, you only see your current room.
- With a torch, you can see the next 2 rooms; with a lantern, you can flip any card once per floor.
- Unexplored rooms go under the Chaos Dragon and return later as consequences.
- You can optionally use a Catan-style token draw to assign room contents.
- Alternate mode: lay out a 5x5 grid of face-down cards and navigate across it.
- Fastest path skips many cards, but skipped cards also feed the Chaos Dragon.
- The grid mode feels like flipping Tarot cards as you go.
- Sword = +1 damage; bow = 1 damage before combat; shield = block on 2 or 3.
- Torch = see ahead; lantern = flip any card; sun stone = nullify or skip a card.
- After laying tiles, open hallways at the map edge become possible exits.

The mirror night card should actually legitimately be mirrored text

Text engraved on the side of the cards or something that if you combine them says a message

Loneliness

Suffering

If the 10 locations represent places that you could get stuck in your life and the skill challenges represent character traits The good events are merciful, wonderful things that happened in your life. The bad things are sort of universally bad life events are difficult ones the weapons represent conceptual schemas or conceptual tools that you need. What should the monsters represent perhaps

Fight flight freeze control
Ignorance
Confrontation
Zeal isolation
Power and self indulgence
Preservation. Rigidity
Hubris and control

Style guide 4.27
[ART STYLE GUIDE: “Inverted Woodcut Minimalism”]

Visual Style:
- Black background with pure white lines and figures.
- Inspired by traditional woodcut or linocut printmaking.
- No gradients, shading, or color variations — only solid black and solid white.

Line Work:
- Thick, heavy linework as the dominant style.
- Rough, slightly jagged, hand-carved appearance for all lines and edges.
- Occasional medium-thick lines for fine details.
- Organic imperfections: small irregularities, scratches, and texture inside white shapes to simulate real printmaking.

Shape Language:
- Simple, bold, geometric forms.
- Subtle use of faceting or angular subdivision inside larger shapes.
- Clean negative space, but edges should feel raw and handcrafted.

Texture:
- Slight scratch textures throughout to prevent surfaces from feeling too flat or digital.
- Texture should mimic the irregularities of old handmade prints, without overwhelming the clarity of shapes.

Composition:
- Centered, vertically balanced designs.
- Plenty of breathing room (negative space) around the main subject.
- Focus on clear, powerful silhouettes.

Typography (if included):
- Serif fonts only.
- All capital letters for titles, slightly italicized, moderate stroke contrast.
- Subtext in smaller, fully italicized serif font, centered alignment.
- Typography should feel classical, sober, and unobtrusive.

Mood and Atmosphere:
- Stark, solemn, ancient.
- Emphasis on simplicity, symbolism, and primal emotional impact.
- Avoid modern effects like glow, blur, or realism; everything should feel raw, carved, and minimal.

General Principles:
- Keep every element minimal but rich with handcrafted texture.
- Prioritize storytelling through strong shapes, not through detail or realism.
- The artwork should feel timeless, mythic, and slightly austere.

Anxiety → Dread → Despair → Faith → Reconciliation

**1. Anxiety**
“I can feel it all—the weight of what I could do. Every path is open, but none are clear. The air feels tight, like I’ve stepped into a room with too many doors and no map. My hands shake, not from fear, but from possibility.”
**2. Dread**
“Something is watching. Or maybe nothing is—and that’s worse. I feel hollow, like I’m being pulled forward by a thread I can’t see. I keep walking, but every step feels heavier. I know I have to choose. And I know it will cost me.”
**3. Despair**
“It’s me. It’s always been me. I thought the world was broken, but it’s me that can’t be fixed. I’ve tried everything I know, and it all falls apart in my hands. There’s no one coming to save me. And I’m not enough.”
**4. Faith**
“I don’t understand. And I won’t pretend I do. But something in me moves anyway—toward the dark, toward the silence, toward what I can’t prove. I leap, not because I’m sure, but because I must. And I land.”
**5. Reconciliation**
“I don’t have all the answers. I don’t need them. I am what I am—no more hiding, no more pretending. The wound is still there, but it doesn’t own me anymore. I walk forward, and this time, I carry myself.”

He loves the idea of learning rules as you play
He thinks that we should go to a very magic oriented, artifact enchantment, equipment curse, blessing system
Some world rules that you learn make the game easier and some make the game hard harder

Heart soul, mind and strength

Avoid - put card on bottom of library

To add: Ways players should die
Don’t understand the rules
Didn’t decide to take on suffering
Didn’t rely on other people
Didn’t get equipped
Some amount of chance

Flavor text:
To be seen
Stripped and raw
Under threat of rending blows
The task of souls imbued with light
Risk our hands in others’ held

But no fire can burn without the setting of a spark

My searching heart
Cries for this
This thing I can’t grasp
A love somewhere within

Try to forget the past
But nothing ever changes
Try to understand
But nothing ever changes
Try to lose myself
But nothing ever changes
Try to love myself
But nothing ever changes

Behind the eyes lies a truth
So deeply concealed
Somewhere inside is a place
Where the weary rest and heal
Anger, fear, and regret keep the darkness at hand

A hollow form with empty hands

**Starting over 4.7.25**

2. Results determine attack and defense outcomes based on the following:
- **1 – Miss**:

- **2 – Parry**:
- Block **1** damage from opponent.
- **3–4 – Hit**:
- Deal **1** damage to opponent.
- **5 – Heavy Hit**:
- Deal **2** damage to opponent.

3. **Damage is applied after both rolls are resolved.**
4. **Repeat** rounds until either the player or enemy’s **HP is reduced to 0 or less**.
5. If player has Active companion cards, each one in turn absorbs next hit of enemy damage, then ‘dies’ and goes to experience pile
6. If player reduces enemy HP to 0 or less, the player wins, heals 1hp, and can move to the next card
2. Mirror Knight
1. Fight enemy with duel system
1. HP is 33 minus current cards in experience pile

KEY: shame about my father

5 relics / 5 rites of passage

- Betrayal / broken ring
- Confronting your shadow / Mirror shard sword
- Confronting meaninglessness / everflame

Forget tuning just add mechanics Vibe
- The chaos dragon should be more of a puzzle than chance
- I want getting to that point to require strategy, trade-offs, self sacrifice, good decision-making and then for the actual chaos dragon fight to be like Trinder Oumed significantly less harmless if you have a few key things
- One idea is that there are good things cards that are give you a significant advantage and they are just sort of like fortunate things and those are the pieces of equipment and the equipment should be symbolic of the things that are just available out there in the world that will help you
- And then I think there should be five key bad thing experiences that if you have them in your experience pile, they also significantly make the chaos dragon fight easier
- But I really want the mid game to be pretty hard
- The symbol for chaos should be a spiral
- The game rules should be revealed by the companions
- If you don’t know the game rules that you don’t know the power, the extra power of the items or the -5 bad thing virtues and therefore, the chaos dragon is probably unbeatable or way way harder
- Maybe the chaos dragon could be in the last 33 cards of the deck or we could balance the game around that being the assumption if that’s it placement
- grab locations and encounters from the Jordan Petersen, masculine and feminine slide
- I hear that companions could all have a fault, but if you’ve encountered the thing and learned a virtue, you can counter that fault
- 6 special monsters that have extra hp and a special kill condition - companions tell you

add run away - avoid this card - delay chaos 3
At the tavern, you can play a game of dice for a chance at a really good thing
A bad thing could be a optional skill challenge
An unlocked door of someone’s house
How is it? That experience cards can be both locks and keys and that experience cards are kind of like an inventory bag too?
Some events could require monster parts specifically
A secret on every card

Game design state 4.5.25
# Origins and fundamental design
I came up with this game while I was camping with my son, Benjamin. I’m a long time fantasy fan and dungeons and Dragons fan and board game fan and everything fan. And I.’ve been trying to teach him. He plays D and D, but I have to simplify the mechanics so that he can understand it. Um, I have a vivid imagination in lots of. background material to pull from. But I understand that not a lot of people do and that can be sort of a barrier to entry But I digress fundamentally, I just came up with a sword dueling game because he and I play sword fight all the time and I forgot my sword when we went camping. So I came up with a fun dice game that sort of. simulates sparring. This is a totally fun game by itself.

**“Blade Clash”**
Each player has a 1d6 and rolls simultaneously. Effects are resolved simultaneously.
Each player has five health.

| Roll | Result | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Miss | No effect |
| 2 | Parry | Blocks one Hit or Double Hit |
| 3 | Hit | Deal 1 damage if unblocked |
| 4 | Hit | Deal 1 damage if unblocked |
| 5 | Double Hit | Deal 2 damage if unblocked |
| 6 | Counter | Block opponent’s attack and deal 1 damage |

If both players counter, that’s a dramatic blade clash! No effect, just looks cool!

**“Adventure”**
Of course, as soon as we played several rounds of this. I started to want to build in more flavor.

This is kind of a great mechanic. Why don’t we have some monster cards and justice? Use this as like a very simple D and D fighting mechanic, where I. can say a monster has so many HP and then my son can use this D6 which is much more common than AD22. fight against it and the monster will just do opposed roles just like in Blade Clash but just with more flavor. You know more adventure.

So I started designing some simple monsters that would have like 2HP 5HP and 10HP.
You fight the Mirror Knight at the end.
That is phase two of our game.

**“Forward”**
Of course, as soon as I made that, I started thinking about what I *really* want in a one-player game. I’m inspired a lot by Kierkegaardian philosophy, Jungian psychoanalysis, Jordan Peterson’s *Maps of Meaning*, and the hero’s journey. I’ve also been a dungeon master for many years, and there are things I’ve learned—deeply thematic elements—and then there’s my own philosophy and experience. Gaming, fantasy worlds, even game mechanics have taught me things about life. Some of them have become heuristics I use to deal with real situations.
So my mind started spinning: how can I make a game that includes all of those things in a way that doesn’t bog you down—but is there *if* you want it?
Because I believe that about life too. Just like all children learn similar things about what life is like—what it’s made of—I believe life has a lot of depth that’s indifferent to discovery. There’s delight and sorrow. I wanted to make a game that reflects that. A few games already do this, in my opinion—*Dark Souls*, for example, or even *Zelda*. Games with a lot of truly optional content. Some of it is aesthetic or experiential, and some of it is a skill challenge. The game lets you turn the volume up if you want to.
I really like that in games.
Another experience that inspired me was being a kid and picking up a monster manual—just seeing the pictures and not really knowing what they meant. I’d come up with my own rules for how things might work because I couldn’t read or decipher what was happening. As an adult, I’ve had a similar experience playing complicated board games like *Battlestar Galactica*, where the rules are so complex that over the years you keep finding better interpretations, or you highlight and circle things in the manual, or make house rules.
So I wanted to make a game that also teaches you how to play *as* you play it—something with emergent discovery of underlying systems. I also wanted diegetic instructions—rules and meaning that come from inside the game’s world rather than being external. The video game *Tunic* did this really cool thing where the in-game menu looked like an old NES-style instruction manual. As you progressed, you collected more pages of it. Some instructions were partial, or cryptic, and I just thought that was so clever. That inspired me too.
In the final mode of the game, I wanted to address something deeper—something I’ve seen in my life and in others. The unknown. The anomalous. The chaos. Negative, surprising things. It’s interesting what prepares us—or fails to prepare us—for those moments.
What I’ve found is that the hardest things I understand can actually help me face the hard things I *don’t* understand. When I look back on my life, it’s the combination of my greatest challenges and the things I’ve gained through sacrifice that build my character—and prepare me for the next anomalous, chaotic thing. Whether that’s a conflict at work, a personal relationship, or an economic setback.
I’ve also noticed that you pay a price for not facing difficult things in the short term. When you avoid them, you miss out on the wisdom or strength you might have gained. And then, when the next challenge comes, it hits harder. For example, if a friend dies and you don’t fully grieve—if you push it away—then when another friend dies, it comes back *double*.
So I imagined the final boss of this game to be the **Dragon of Chaos**.
The core mechanic of the final form is still an adventure—semi-randomized—but with deeper layers. Early in the game, certain event cards just look like illustrations. But in later stages, through diegetic storytelling (from characters inside the game), you begin to learn what the symbols mean, and what your choices are.
For instance, you might come across someone undeserving asking for food. If you have a food card, you can choose to give it to them. That card then goes into a special pile called **Experience**. You also add to this pile when you defeat a monster or make a sacrificial choice, like trading some of your health to help someone in need. There are also cards that represent painful events—like the death of a friend, or getting lost on a cold night. These hurt you but also go into the Experience pile.
You *can* choose not to go through those experiences. You could walk past someone in need and keep your food or your health. In that case, the card goes back into the deck rather than into your Experience pile.
Eventually, you’ll reach the Dragon of Chaos. And its power is based on how many cards are under it. If you’ve avoided hard experiences, the dragon will be stronger. And it’s already hard to beat.
There are also companions you can meet along the way. Each one will take a hit for you in combat and then go into your Experience pile. Some events may also cause you to lose a companion. But when you face the dragon, all your companions come back to take hits for you again.
In this way, I’m trying to tell a moral lesson—something I believe to be true:
Life really only offers you one direction to move, and that’s **forward**.
It’s full of difficult circumstances—but also unexpected delights, mercies, graces, and friends. The Dragon of Chaos is out there. And you will have to fight it.
But you fight it with what you’ve pulled from chaos into knowing—into **experience**.
Our character is shaped by what we’ve done, and how we’ve responded to the plan.
And so this is the game I’m making.
I hope it can be many things to many people.
But first of all, I hope I can be proud of it—and that it says something true about how I see the world at this time in my life.

Some kind of scry
Bad things that give you virtues good things that give you faults
What if the game didn’t tell you how to play other than two shuffle up and there were symbols on the cards that would do things but only if you had drawn the card that taught you what the symbol was so the idea would be that the first time you played the game, a bunch of cards would do nothing and you would for sure die But then as you played the game, you would uncover events that would make the game make the game easier to strategize with for example, the chaos dragon horse has the power of the cards underneath it, but maybe you don’t know how the experience pile works until you play the game and somewhat tells you how experience works or something like that
The archetypes
The hero’s journey
Have good characteristics and then basically throw them at everything you encounter until you get a lucky strike
Fogwall
Could it be intuit and foresee for Scry and blind pick
Enemy giant isopod
Come across people white yoy wuests?
Maybe there’s a collect three quest where it’s just items you get and if you get three they power up
Items that you can trade in for coins, but if you have more than 5 coins, at one time, you have the sin of avarice
Similar for food if you have more than five food you have gluttony
You don’t take on a quest you have sloth?

my philosophy
- real reps
- locked doors are good
- hard mode expectations
- forward
- problem solution ordering
- meta / domain experieince
- outerbound ontology
- open vs closed puzzles

Child version is sparring
Adolescent version is 50 card storytelling with monsters fighting - baby DnD, final boss mirror knight
Coming of age is full game
One option for the game is to make every monster make some monsters kind of weak, but I think a better version of the game would be that every monster is substantial and scary so that if it were four battles in a year, it would really make a difference
A rule to keep in mind for the difficulty it should technically be possible to defeat the chaos dragon if it were the first card that you pulled - very very low chance like one percent

Every card is a season of earth

The game should get harder the more you know the rules

I love the idea of a rulebook with blanks where you have to fill in the blanks as you find the cards that explain what the icons mean
- maybe there’s a rule that is actually the opposite that only a card will tell you

I also love the experience of the game being something kids could make up their own rules to, and that would be fine and it could just be inspiring Art

And maybe there is a hidden message that a strange hermit will tell you or a cairn or something

**Blogging the Development of *Forward***

I’ve been thinking about blogging everything I’m doing—all the steps I take, all the thoughts I have—while developing *Forward*. A lot of what I’m doing feels less like crafting something new and more like playing out a move I already made, as if I’m living out a truth instead of a lie.

From the outside, someone might look at how emotionally connected I am to certain decisions I’ve made—how satisfied I seem—and say, *“He’s living a lie.”* They might assume I’m in denial, that I’d rather be an artist or something else entirely. And they might not be wrong.

But the strange thing is, I’ve followed a path—step by step, door by door—that I didn’t exactly choose for myself. It was never *my* dream life. And yet, it’s the life that presented itself, that seemed like the one a better version of me would choose. Not the easier life, not the one I wanted, but the one I somehow *knew* to follow.

And so I did. I’ve followed that thread through conflict, dissatisfaction, confusion, disassociation—all of it. But I’m still here. I’m still alive.

And I think, somehow, I’ve experienced more days on earth because of it. I’ve seen more beauty. I’ve had more chances to express myself. I’ve had more of a platform for becoming than I would’ve had if I had simply chased my desires.

Still, I feel like an unreal creature sometimes. Like everyone else is living in a shared reality while I’m just drifting through, watering someone else’s plants at night, in a state I didn’t choose, in a house I didn’t pick, working a job I didn’t chase—but one I ended up with, not out of desperation, but by a kind of quiet momentum.

And yet… when I create things—when I imagine, when I build systems, when I explore fictional worlds or even real ones—I feel real. That’s the truest part of me. That’s the part of me that knows who I am.
