Bug Hunter is a game set in a forest world full of giant bugs and tiny jungle village creatures that wear bone armor and their like feral little kids bone kids in the game of bug hunt you are celebrating the yearly Bug Hunt Festival which is a three day challenge for who can hunt the most bugs The game takes place over three rounds where you pick a bug hunter who has a specialty like they're good against ground bugs or they're good against flying bugs or they're good against armored bugs and you pick a kid and you go out and then there's a map and the bugs are randomly distributed on the map And there's three size categories of bugs that are worth different amounts of points and have different amounts of health and your job is you move your piece and you go towards a bug and when you fight a bug you roll a 6 sided dice until you hit the number of health that that bug has and then you get that bug token and it's worth a certain amount of points at the end of the day so you get as far as you can on your day and then if you want to team up with someone you can team up maybe I don't know but so the way that the battle works is you get next to it you have to move into a space with a bug then you roll dice and every Every time you roll you add up the damage until you hit their health Way for you to take damage which I will then I'll figure that out but then you go through it and when the timer runs out that day is over and the hunt stops and everyone collects their points then between days you can either keep your points and add them towards your total or you can spend your points on items which are cards

When you roll a one you get damaged for the bugs sting value

Yeah so ideas for The character the characters are you can get a spear and that's plus two against armored or maybe plus one against armored bugs you could get a bow that's plus one against flying bugs or you can get a net or a bug bomb

smoke bomb will help you get past one and then there's poison that autokills a bug

At the end of day three there is a huge battle against the Queen Bee and everyone has to team up and try to defeat it before day three is done if you do something cool happens but I haven't figured out what that is or maybe everyone loses I don't know
