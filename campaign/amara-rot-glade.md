# Amara Rot Glade (Level 6) - Complete Adventure

Premise: Bog of rot, betrayal, and grief. Lay her to rest, survive treachery, and claim a cleansing boon.

Table stakes
- Themes: decay, betrayal, funerary rites.
- Stakes: earn a cleansing charm, avoid poison/rot, decide whom to trust.
- Hooks: rumor of a rite that lifts curses; path to Spiremaze crosses here.

Cast (quick stats)
- Grieving Spirit (banshee reskinned: no Wail; instead Frightful Moan DC 13).
- Rot Priest (cult fanatic with Poison Spray cantrip; resistance to poison).
- Treacherous Guide (assassin with Nature +4).
- Rot beasts: 2 Ghouls (poison instead of paralysis), Shambling Mound.

Map sketch (zones)
- A) Sink Trail: mud, biting flies.
- B) Black-Thorn Grove: bleeding sap; minor poison.
- C) Rotting Altar: site for Lay Her to Rest.
- D) Hollow Log Camp: guide's camp; ambush site.
- E) Fen Pool: Shambling Mound lair.

Keyed scenes (3 sessions)
1) A. Entrance: Con save DC 13 vs poisoned (1 hour). Survival DC 13 to avoid sinkholes (fail = restrained until freed).
2) D. Guide parley: Guide offers to lead for 20 gp; Insight DC 14 spots ill intent. Following him reduces travel DCs by 2 but triggers ambush later.
3) B. Black-thorn hazard: Moving through causes 1d4 piercing and Con save DC 12 vs poisoned. Collect sap for a poison bomb (1d6 poison, DC 13 Con half).
4) C. Lay Her to Rest rite: Religion/Performance DC 14, 2 successes needed. Failures enrage Grieving Spirit (combat). Success grants her blessing and advantage vs disease for 24h.
5) Ambush/Climax: At D on return, Guide betrays with 2 Ghouls. If suspicious PCs preempt, skip ambush and face Rot Priest + 2 Ghouls at the altar instead. If noise draws the Shambling Mound from E, it joins on round 3.
6) E. Optional lair: Shambling Mound guards a corpse cache with rot-slick loot.

Missions and options
- Primary: Complete the rite; gain cleansing boon.
- Secondary: Expose or redeem the guide; harvest black-thorn sap.
- Optional twist: If the rite is botched, a lingering curse afflicts one PC (disadvantage on death saves) until cleansed at Frozen Gaol or by the Lantern.

Treasure/boons
- Cleansing charm: End one curse/Snare; once only.
- Rot salve: advantage on one poison save; 1 use.
- Corpse cache: 120 gp, potion of greater healing, scroll of Protection from Poison.

Escalation/clock
- Each poisoned hour increases DCs by 1. At 3 poisoned hours, gain 1 level exhaustion.
- If the guide survives, he can reappear in Spiremaze as informant or saboteur.*** End Patch
