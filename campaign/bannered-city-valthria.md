# Bannered City Valthria (Level 2) - Complete Adventure

Premise: Stratified, corrupt city where status is law and waste is shadow. Goal: secure the Golden Bangle and exit alive.

Table stakes
- Themes: class cruelty, bureaucracy, grime.
- Stakes: obtain the Bangle, avoid arrest, expose a Magister.
- Hooks: hired to retrieve a relic; fleeing Termina; following a map fragment.

Cast (quick stats)
- Watch squad: 1 sergeant (veteran) + 4 guards (thugs).
- Magister Ellard (if recurring): mage with Counterspell replaced by Shield.
- Fence/antiquarian: commoner with Arcana +4, sells intel.
- Sewer guide: scout, may betray for 20 gp.
- Refuse Ooze: black pudding reskin; slower (speed 20), acid as normal.

District map (zones)
- A) South Gate: shakedowns and bribes.
- B) Bannered Avenues: processions, social pressure.
- C) Vast Markets: fences, pickpockets.
- D) Alleys braid/unbraid: chase web; 3 exits.
- E) Sewers: ooze lair, hidden access to the Magister's vault.
- F) Magistrate Vault: Golden Bangle held in evidence chest.

Keyed scenes (3 sessions)
1) A. Gate shakedown: Skill challenge DC 12 (Persuasion/Deception/Intimidation). Failure: 10 gp fine and watch tail; combat if refused.
2) D. Alley chase: Lose the tail with Athletics/Acrobatics/Insight DC 13; failure = ambush by 2 thugs; success = reach the fence unseen.
3) C. Market intrigue: Roleplay with fence. Options to get vault location: pay 25 gp, do a favor (steal a ledger), or trade proof from Termina.
4) E. Sewer path: Hazards (slime drip DC 12 Dex for 1d6 acid), 1 Refuse Ooze encounter, collapsing walkway (Dex save DC 13 or prone).
5) F. Vault/Climax: Stealth in (2 guards, DC 13 locks) or frontal fight vs sergeant + 4 guards; if Ellard appears, add him as boss. The Bangle is in chest with 50 gp, 2 healing potions.
6) Exit: Heat check-if alarms, a city-wide chase; if quiet, slip out with guide. Heat carries to later Domains as higher pursuit.

Missions and options
- Primary: Steal or win the Golden Bangle.
- Secondary: Expose Magister's ledgers; free a jailed dissident in the sewers (helps later).
- Optional twist: The sewer guide sells PCs out mid-run; spot it with Insight DC 14.

Treasure/boons
- Golden Bangle (key for Ghostly Princess).
- 50 gp, 2 healing potions, ledgers that reduce future bribes by half if leveraged.
- Market contacts: advantage on one future social check in Valthria circles.

Escalation/clock
- Every loud fight adds 1 heat; at 3 heat, a full Watch platoon (veteran + 6 thugs) hunts them.
- If Ellard survives, he raises heat in later cities; if captured, he can bargain intel about Shrine/Ferryman's Bell.*** End Patch
