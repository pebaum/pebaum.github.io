# Forgotten Shrine (Level 3) - Complete Adventure

Premise: Luminous ruin of an older faith. The Ancient Sword sleeps beneath star-wrought wards.

Table stakes
- Themes: reverence, light vs encroaching shadow.
- Stakes: claim the Sword, earn a blessing, avoid waking too much wrath.
- Hooks: rumor of a blade that can harm the Guardian; map from Valthria; acolyte in exile asks for aid.

Cast (quick stats)
- Shrine spirits (2 shadows, 1 wraith), Bone Knight (wight with plate/AC 18, greatsword 2d6+3).
- Lantern keeper (will-o-wisp demeanor; treat as harmless NPC).

Map sketch (zones)
- A) Fallen Arch: cracked star sigils.
- B) Constellation Hall: floor tiles that light when stepped; puzzle.
- C) Reliquary Side Chamber: spectral lantern.
- D) Sword Dais: radiant wards, guardian.
- E) Exit Culvert: waterlogged escape with lurking shadow.

Keyed scenes (3 sessions)
1) A. Threshold: Identify sigils (Arcana/Religion DC 12) for advantage on the puzzle. Failure wakes 1 shadow.
2) B. Constellation puzzle: Match ceiling stars to floor tiles (Int check DC 13; 3 successes). Each fail triggers a radiant pulse (Dex save DC 12, 1d6 radiant) and advances a wraith clock (on 3rd fail, wraith appears).
3) C. Lantern room: Lantern keeper echo offers a boon if given a memory (roleplay) or HP (2 hp); boon = advantage vs fear for 24h, and hint about ward timing.
4) D. Sword dais: Crossing wards requires timing (Dex save DC 13 or 1d8 radiant). Guardian Bone Knight fights until bloodied, then bargains: answer a question (Religion DC 14) to end combat or finish the fight.
5) E. Exit: Water culvert; stealth past a shadow (or fight) while carrying the Sword.

Missions and options
- Primary: Claim the Ancient Sword.
- Secondary: Earn lantern boon; avoid waking full wrath (wraith + bone knight together).
- Optional twist: If PCs desecrate the shrine, all radiant wards flip to necrotic, and lantern snuffs (lose boon).

Treasure/boons
- Ancient Sword: +1 longsword; vs Guardian counts as key; once per day parry (reaction to gain +2 AC).
- Spectral lantern: 1/short rest advantage vs fear/darkness, sheds dim light immune to magical darkness suppression.
- Minor treasure: 60 gp in relics (if taken at a reverence cost).

Escalation/clock
- Each puzzle fail steps a wrath clock; at 3, wraith joins; at 4, Bone Knight gains +2 dmg.
- If PCs flee, the Sword remains warded; next attempt has +2 DCs until a full rest passes.*** End Patch
