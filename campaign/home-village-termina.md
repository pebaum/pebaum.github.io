# Home Village Termina (Level 1) - Complete Adventure

Premise: Occupied hometown under Valthrian rule. Smoke, grief, and the first vow. Ends with a routed magistrate and a map to the path forward.

Table stakes
- Themes: oppression, grief, first defiance.
- Stakes: save kin, expose Ellard's crimes, secure a route out.
- Hooks: PCs are locals or arrive to aid refugees; promised pay by a hidden cell; seeking the rumored Golden City route.

Cast (quick stats)
- Patrol (4 bandits), Lieutenant (veteran with Intimidation +4), Cinder Mage (priest reskin with fire).
- Villagers (commoners), Cell leader (scout), Grieving parent (commoner).

Map sketch (zones)
- A) Orchards of Ash: light cover, smoke grants half cover vs ranged >30 ft.
- B) Vigil Hollow: hidden camp; short rest if kept secret.
- C) Salted Fields: difficult terrain; hidden ditch for ambush.
- D) Magistrate Manor: 2-story, guard post, record room, vault.
- E) Granary Row: burning hazard.

Keyed scenes (3 sessions)
1) A. Smoke along the lanes: Skill challenge (Stealth/Deception/Perception DC 12) to bypass patrols; failure triggers a skirmish with 4 bandits.
2) B. Vigil and vow: Roleplay. Choices: bury the dead (time cost, +Resolve), evacuate (gain followers, increase pursuit), or protest (risk mob violence). Secret cell leader offers help if PCs bring proof against Ellard.
3) E. Granary collapse: Fire hazard (Dex save DC 12 or 1d6 fire, restrained on fail); trapped villagers to rescue. Success earns local support and advantage on future persuasion.
4) D. Manor infiltration: Two approaches:
   - Stealth: evade 2 guards (bandits) and a dog (mastiff), steal records in 3rd room (Investigation DC 13).
   - Open confrontation: Lieutenant (veteran) + 4 guards; add Cinder Mage if noisy.
5) D. Vault/evidence: Find Ellard's decrees (proof), 50 gp, healer's kit, map fragment pointing to Bannered City, rumor of Forgotten Shrine.
6) Finale choices: Drive off Ellard's men or cut a deal (bribe 40 gp). Success = safe exit route; failure = extra heat in Valthria later.

Missions and options
- Primary: Secure proof of atrocities and a route forward.
- Secondary: Rescue kin from a holding shed; sabotage supply carts (reduces patrols if revisited).
- Optional twist: An inside guard will switch sides for 10 gp or promise of amnesty.

Treasure/boons
- Heirloom charm: 1/long rest reroll vs fear.
- Map fragment to Valthria and Shrine.
- 50-100 gp total in coin and bribes; one potion of healing in manor chest.

Escalation/clock
- Noise or delays add a patrol (2 bandits) each hour.
- If PCs kill the Lieutenant, Ellard himself may appear later in Valthria as a vengeful magister. If spared, he can be flipped for intel.*** End Patch
