# Guardian / Golden City (Level 11) - Complete Adventure

Premise: Final seal test and battle. Only the Ancient Sword can harm the Guardian; three seals (Aporia, Acedia, Agnosia) must be broken by Bell+Sage, Mirror Knight, and Ghostly Princess.

Table stakes
- Themes: culmination, consequence, light vs void.
- Stakes: win or the world remains under shadow; allies may fall.
- Hooks: Path only opens if Nightsea crossed with Bell and Sage; Sword in hand; companions ready.

Cast (quick stats)
- Guardian: Legendary dragon/construct hybrid. AC 18, HP 260, Legendary Resistance 3. Immune to damage unless struck by Ancient Sword (others half damage). Multiattack 3 (bite/claw/tail), radiant/necrotic mix. Lair actions below.
- Mirror Shades (shadows with +2 to hit/dmg) appear if seals missing.
- Allies: Mirror Knight (as Knight with +1 greatsword), Ghostly Princess (reaction: cancel fear once/round), Sage (ritual support: 1/encounter grant advantage on a save).

Arena map (zones)
- A) Blackened Plaza: difficult terrain (cracked glass).
- B) Broken Colonnade: half cover pillars; lair blasts shatter them.
- C) Mirror Knight's Echo Blade (memory).
- D) Sealed Gate: light seeps; open only after Guardian drops.

Seal audit
- Aporia: Bell + Sage present. If absent, Guardian gains lair action "Fog of Unknowing" (impose disadvantage on next attack roll of all PCs).
- Acedia: Mirror Knight allied. If absent, Guardian regenerates 15 HP at end of its turn.
- Agnosia: Ghostly Princess allied. If absent, Guardian reflects first hit each round back to attacker (once/round).

Lair actions (one/round on 20)
- Shadow Gale: All PCs Dex save DC 16 or pushed 15 ft and prone.
- Corona Radiation: 15-ft beam, Dex save DC 16, 4d8 radiant (half on save).
- Devour: 10-ft grab, Con save DC 16 or restrained and 3d6 necrotic; repeat save end of turn.
- If Aporia unbroken: Fog of Unknowing (see above). If Acedia unbroken: Regenerate. If Agnosia unbroken: Mirror Riposte (first hit reflected).

Flow (2-3 sessions)
1) Approach/roleplay: Allies can be positioned; optional sacrifice (spend an ally's action each round to suppress a lair action).
2) Seal check: Apply missing-seal penalties. PCs may attempt a ritual (Arcana/Religion DC 17, 3 successes) to temporarily negate one missing-seal effect for 3 rounds.
3) Battle phases: At 50% HP, Guardian gains flight (hover) and tail sweeps; at 25%, it shatters pillars (no more cover) and adds lair damage +2.
4) Victory: Gate opens; light floods. If an ally died, their spirit lingers; epilogue choice can restore one Domain or redeem one NPC.

Missions and options
- Primary: Kill/banish Guardian.
- Secondary: Keep allies alive; preserve the Sword.
- Optional twist: If Ancient Sword was not upgraded (never blessed at Shrine), add +2 to Guardian AC until the Sword lands 3 hits.

Treasure/boons
- Ancient Sword surges to +2 vs Guardian and counts as Sunblade for light.
- Gate boon: choose one restored Domain to epilogue; each choice shifts the world's tone.

Escalation/clock
- Each PC drop to 0 adds 1 despair; at 3 despair, Guardian immediately takes another lair action.
- If battle exceeds 10 rounds, Guardian calls 1d4 Mirror Shades each round thereafter.*** End Patch
