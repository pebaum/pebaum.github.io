# Nightsea Expanse (Levels 9-10) - Complete Adventure

Premise: A black ocean that swallows the unprepared. Only The Sage with Ferryman's Bell can guide the rite.

Table stakes
- Themes: liminality, doom, tolling passage.
- Stakes: survive the crossing, keep the Bell intact, learn one truth about the Guardian.
- Hooks: Sage insists this is the only way; Bell obtained in Nightsea or earlier.

Cast (quick stats)
- Sage (ritual caster).
- Ferryman Shade (wraith flavor, but negotiator; only fights if cheated).
- Sea Wraiths (2 wraiths), Ghost Pirates (use bandit captain + 3 bandits with necrotic attacks), Kraken Tentacle (single limb, HP 60, bludgeoning/grapple).
- Banshee Keener (banshee; Wail only if PCs break the bargain).

Map sketch (zones)
- A) Bone Pier: start, Bell toll.
- B) Open Water: rowing skill challenge.
- C) Maelstrom Ring: hazard.
- D) Ghost Flotilla: derelicts drifting.
- E) Shadow Gate: exit to Guardian shore.

Keyed scenes (3 sessions)
1) A. Bell rite: Perform with Sage (Arcana/Religion DC 15). Success grants 3 tokens to cancel one failed check each; failure awakens the Shade hostile later.
2) B. Crossing challenge: Three checks (Athletics/Survival/Con DC 15) to row and hold course. Each fail: lose 1 gear (GM pick) or take 1d6+3 cold. On 2+ fails, spawn 1 sea wraith.
3) C. Maelstrom: Dex save DC 15 to avoid being pitched; fail = prone and 2d6 bludgeoning. Kraken tentacle may strike here if clock is high.
4) D. Bargain with Ferryman Shade: Pay memory (lose one known language or one proficiency until long rest), blood (2d6 HP), or Resolve (if you track). In return, ask one true question about the Guardian or negate next lair action in final fight. Refuse = combat.
5) D/E. Boarding fight: Ghost pirates or sea wraiths try to take the Bell. Limited space; forced movement risks falling (Dex save DC 15 to catch rigging or fall in for 2d6 cold and grapple by tentacle).
6) E. Landfall: If Bell intact, short rest with boon; if broken, take a level of exhaustion and arrive with +1 Guardian lair action.

Missions and options
- Primary: Cross and keep Bell intact.
- Secondary: Secure a truth about the Guardian; preserve supplies.
- Optional twist: If PCs throw someone overboard, the Shade demands two prices later; if unpaid, Banshee Keener arrives in the Guardian fight.

Treasure/boons
- Bell-touched token: reroll one fear save before or during Guardian fight.
- Truth boon: one accurate fact about Guardian defenses or HP threshold.
- Calm wake: if no fights, gain temp HP 10 each on landfall.

Escalation/clock
- Each failed crossing check or loud fight adds 1. At 2+, Ghost Pirates board; at 3+, Kraken tentacle attacks; at 4, Bell cracks (needs mending or disadvantage on rite).*** End Patch
