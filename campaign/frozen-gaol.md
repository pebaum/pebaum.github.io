# Frozen Gaol (Level 8) - Complete Adventure

Premise: An ice prison for dissidents and threats. Choose who to free; battle the Austere Leviathan or the gaoler's cadre.

Table stakes
- Themes: captivity, moral choices, cold attrition.
- Stakes: allies vs security, map to Nightsea, cold protection.
- Hooks: rumor of prisoners with Nightsea bearings; need cold wards before the Expanse.

Cast (quick stats)
- Gaoler Mage (mage with cold flavor; swap Fireball for Ice Knife at 3rd, Cone of Cold once).
- Winter Wolf, 4 Ice Guards (veterans with cold resist potions), 2 Ice Mephits.
- Austere Leviathan (young white dragon).
- Rebel leader (scout), Sage's contact prisoner (commoner with Nightsea lore).

Map sketch (zones)
- A) Cracking Bridge over a chasm.
- B) Ice Cells (row of frozen prisoners).
- C) Gaoler's Study (scrolls, keys).
- D) Fracturing Floor Hall.
- E) Lair Cavern (dragon or mage stronghold).

Keyed scenes (3 sessions)
1) A. Bridge: Dex/Athletics DC 14 to cross; on fail, fall prone and take 1d6 bludgeoning + 1d6 cold; rope mitigates.
2) B. Ice Cells: Freeing requires Str check DC 14 or fire/force. Free up to 3 before alarm; each prisoner freed reduces later enemy count by 1 (escaped guard). Sage's contact provides Nightsea bearings.
3) C. Study: Find cold-ward charms and a map; Investigation DC 13. Noise here raises alert. Mephit patrol (2) every 10 minutes.
4) D. Fracturing floor: During combat, each round roll d6; on 1-2, a 10 ft square cracks (Dex save DC 14 or fall prone, take 1d6 cold).
5) E. Climax choice:
   - Dragon route: Leviathan (young white dragon) in lair; treasure hoard.
   - Gaoler route: Mage + Winter Wolf + 2 veterans; if high alert, add 2 mephits.

Missions and options
- Primary: Obtain Nightsea bearings and cold wards; survive boss.
- Secondary: Free key prisoners (rebel leader aids later; reduce enemy count).
- Optional twist: If many prisoners freed, the dragon focuses on them, giving PCs advantage but risking casualties (morality choice).

Treasure/boons
- Cold-ward charms: resist cold for 24 hours (1 each PC).
- Map with Nightsea bearings (lowers Nightsea challenge DCs by 2).
- Hoard/loot: 300 gp, 2 potions of greater healing, scroll of Protection from Energy (cold), +1 shield of frost (resist cold 1/day for 1 minute).

Escalation/clock
- Each freed prisoner adds 1 alarm; at 3 alarms, Gaoler Mage is alerted and buffs allies; at 4, Leviathan is restless (arrives mid-fight on round 3).*** End Patch
