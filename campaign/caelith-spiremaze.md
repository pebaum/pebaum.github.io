# Caelith Spiremaze (Level 7) - Complete Adventure

Premise: Vertical stone labyrinth of riddles, winds, and echoes. Secure the Ghostly Princess as ally and preserve the maze's lore.

Table stakes
- Themes: knowledge, vertigo, lost royalty.
- Stakes: gain Princess ally (breaks Agnosia seal), avoid falls, keep the shard safe.
- Hooks: Golden Bangle lead points here; Sage's clue about Princess; pilgrims trapped inside.

Cast (quick stats)
- Sphinx Scholar (gynosphinx but reduce HP by 25% and remove time stop).
- Gargoyles (2-4), Air Elemental in a wind tunnel.
- Ghostly Princess (incorporeal NPC; grants advantage vs fear once/short rest).
- Trapped pilgrim (commoner) who knows riddle hint.

Map sketch (vertical zones)
- A) Wind Ledge: entry, sheer drop; gusts.
- B) Rotating Platforms: shifting rings; puzzle.
- C) Riddle Chamber: Sphinx, murals of Bangle.
- D) Mirror Pedestal: force wards, shard trap.
- E) Princess's Balcony: spectral court, Bangle offering.

Keyed scenes (3 sessions)
1) A. Wind Ledge: Gust hazard (Str or Dex save DC 14 or be pushed 10 ft; failure near edge requires Dex save DC 15 or fall 30 ft, 3d6 dmg). Gargoyles harass during checks.
2) B. Platform puzzle: Int check DC 14 to align rings; 3 successes before 2 fails. Each fail rotates paths, forcing Acrobatics DC 13 or fall to ledge below (take 2d6). Success opens route to C; fail spawns Air Elemental encounter.
3) C. Sphinx parley: Answer a riddle (offer one; success = safe passage and hint about Bangle), fail = fight weakened sphinx (uses claw/multiattack only). Offering lore or a relic grants advantage.
4) D. Mirror pedestal: Trap rune (Dex save DC 14 or 2d8 force + shunted back to B). Studying (Arcana DC 13) reveals a hidden mirror shard usable as 1/day 1d8 force dagger.
5) E. Ghostly Princess: Must be given the Golden Bangle to follow. Social challenge (Persuasion DC 15, advantage if Bangle presented). If insulted, she flees and will not aid at the Guardian fight.

Missions and options
- Primary: Recruit Ghostly Princess.
- Secondary: Preserve the shard; befriend sphinx for future lore answers (once, any question answered truthfully).
- Optional twist: If PCs break mirrors, maze shifts; add +2 DCs and another gargoyle group before exit.

Treasure/boons
- Ghostly Princess ally (fear ward; required for Agnosia seal).
- Mirror shard dagger: 1/day 1d8 force dagger attack (counts as magical).
- Sphinx favor: one true answer later (no mechanics, GM fiat).

Escalation/clock
- Each fall or loud fight raises Alert by 1. At Alert 2, add 2 more gargoyles in the next scene. At Alert 3, Sphinx begins hostile.*** End Patch
