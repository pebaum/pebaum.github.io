# Darkwood Brume (Level 4) - Complete Adventure

Premise: Mist-soaked forest that saps will. Find and recruit The Sage; avoid getting lost or hunted.

Table stakes
- Themes: disorientation, whispers, fragile hope.
- Stakes: secure The Sage, learn about Ferryman's Bell, avoid Snares and exhaustion.
- Hooks: following Shrine lore; rumors of a guide who knows the Nightsea rite.

Cast (quick stats)
- The Sage (commoner stat, Ritual Casting, knows Bell rite).
- Warden Captain (knight with Perception +4, sees through light obscurement), 4 Wardens (bandits).
- Mist Shades (2 shadows), Specter.

Map sketch (zones)
- A) Threshold Stones: fog barrier, runes.
- B) Brook in the Shade: risky rest site.
- C) Fern Maze: paths loop; brume pockets.
- D) Warden Waypoint: patrol camp, signal horns.
- E) Sage's Hollow: hidden, trapped approach.
- F) Night Path: exit toward Wastes.

Keyed scenes (3 sessions)
1) A. Entering the Brume: Navigation check (Survival DC 13). Fail = 1 level exhaustion (ignores on a success by any PC) and encounter 1 shade.
2) C. Fern Maze hazard: Skill challenge to avoid Snares (Perception/Nature DC 13, 3 successes before 2 fails). Failures impose poisoned or hexed (disadvantage on Wis checks) until a short rest.
3) B. Brook rest: Short rest allowed, but on a random encounter roll (1-2 on d6) a specter drifts by; if parleyed, it offers a clue for a memory.
4) E. Sage's Hollow: Approach trapped logs (Dex save DC 13 or 2d6 bludgeoning). Roleplay: convince Sage with one of: present the Shrine lantern (auto succeed), prove intent (Persuasion DC 14), or aid a lost traveler to gain trust.
5) D. Warden strike: Once Sage agrees, horns sound; fight Warden Captain + 2 Wardens + 1 shade. If too noisy earlier, add 2 more Wardens.
6) F. Exit: Sage shares Bell rite and needs the Bell from Nightsea; grants a Brume charm.

Missions and options
- Primary: Recruit The Sage.
- Secondary: Capture a Warden horn to reduce future patrols; rescue the lost traveler (becomes ally in Wastes).
- Optional twist: If you leave the Sage, the Wardens seize him and you must rescue him later at higher DCs.

Treasure/boons
- Brume charm: ignore one level of exhaustion once.
- Scroll fragment: keywords for Ferryman's Bell rite (helps in Nightsea; lowers DC by 2).
- Horn of Echoes: 1/day cast Fog Cloud (self only) at 1st level.

Escalation/clock
- Each loud fight adds +1 alert. At 2+, Warden Captain arrives in next scene. At 3, a specter hunts during rests.
- High Dread (if tracked) imposes disadvantage on navigation until resolved by rest or charm.*** End Patch
