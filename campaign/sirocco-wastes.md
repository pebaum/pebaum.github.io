# Sirocco Wastes (Level 5) - Complete Adventure

Premise: Shifting desert that eats metal and memory. Claim the Mirror Shard and turn the Mirror Knight from foe to ally.

Table stakes
- Themes: mirage, reflection, endurance.
- Stakes: secure the Shard, survive the Knight, avoid being buried or lost.
- Hooks: Sage's hint points here; scavengers mention a shard that shows your true self.

Cast (quick stats)
- Scavenger boss (bandit captain), 4 scavengers (bandits).
- Mirror Knight (uses a PC's AC/HP and attack bonus; immune until shown Shard).
- Sand Elemental (air elemental reskinned with bludgeoning damage), Giant Scorpion.

Map sketch (zones)
- A) Dune Traverse: heat checks.
- B) Scavenger Camp at half-buried ribs.
- C) Tar Pits and Crimson Vines.
- D) Mirage Path: hazard corridor.
- E) Shard Pedestal Ruin.
- F) Mirror Knight Arena (windswept flat).

Keyed scenes (3 sessions)
1) A. Heat trek: Con save DC 13 or gain 1 level exhaustion (can be reduced by 1 with 1 waterskin). Random ambush (1-2 on d6): Giant Scorpion.
2) B. Scavenger parley: Trade 30 gp, a favor (escort), or duel (non-lethal vs boss) to learn Shard location. Failure = hostility (fight).
3) C. Tar pits: 3 checks to cross (Athletics/Acrobatics DC 14). Fail: stuck, lose an item (GM choice), take 1d6 acid unless freed. Crimson vines attack as 2 Vine Blights.
4) D. Mirage Path: Int/Wis checks DC 13 to stay on course. Fail twice: Sand Elemental encounter.
5) E. Shard pedestal: Trap rune (Dex save DC 13 or 2d6 force). Retrieve Mirror Shard (action).
6) F. Mirror Knight duel: Begins immediately. Knight copies a random PC's AC/HP/attack bonus. Immune to damage until shown the Shard (action to present). Once shown, he switches sides; if fought to 0, the Shard shatters (bad).

Missions and options
- Primary: Obtain Mirror Shard and recruit Mirror Knight.
- Secondary: Escort scavengers to earn desert maps (advantage on future nav).
- Optional twist: A second shard fragment can be used as a one-time 1d8 force dagger, but doing so weakens the full Shard's integrity (Knight loses 1 helpful ability later).

Treasure/boons
- Mirror Shard (key to Knight; keep as focus).
- Desert salve: once remove 1 exhaustion and heal 2d4+2.
- Scavenger map: advantage on future Survival checks in desert regions.

Escalation/clock
- Sun clock: every hour of delay adds 1 level of exhaustion to an exposed PC (Con save DC 12 halves). At 3 levels, they collapse.
- If the Knight is angered (no Shard shown), he will hunt the party later with an elite stat block until calmed by the Shard.*** End Patch
