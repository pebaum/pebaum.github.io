- **ENHC-05**: Fix identified tech debt in individual projects

## Out of Scope

Explicitly excluded. Documented to prevent scope creep.

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Custom domains | Using GitHub Pages default URLs is sufficient |
| CI/CD pipelines | Not needed for static projects |
| Dependency updates | Move as-is, modernize later |
| Code cleanup | Preserve current state, refactor post-migration |
| Documentation | Add READMEs in v2, not during migration |
| Bug fixes | Migrate bugs and all, fix later |
