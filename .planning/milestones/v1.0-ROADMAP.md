# Milestone v1.0: Portfolio Repository Migration

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-01-20
**Phases:** 1-4
**Total Plans:** 7

## Overview

This roadmap transforms a monolithic 300MB+ portfolio repository into a hub-and-spoke architecture with 10 independent project repositories. The migration follows a sequential path: establish GitHub infrastructure, migrate project content with special handling for multi-version projects, clean up the original monorepo, and finally update portfolio links to point to the new distributed architecture.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Repository Setup

**Goal**: All GitHub infrastructure is ready to receive project content
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase)
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 01-01: Create 10 GitHub repositories and enable Pages

**Details:**
- Requirements: REPO-01, REPO-02, REPO-03, REPO-04
- Success Criteria:
  1. 10 new GitHub repositories exist with exact project folder names
  2. All repositories are under the same GitHub account
  3. GitHub Pages is enabled for each repository
  4. Each project is accessible at pebaum.github.io/[project-name]/
- Completed: 2026-01-19

### Phase 2: Content Migration

**Goal**: All 10 projects exist in their own repositories with proper structure
**Depends on**: Phase 1
**Plans**: 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 02-01: Migrate 4 simple projects (4-track, dnd-dm-screen, granular-ambient, textscape)
- [x] 02-02: Migrate 4 simple projects (dualshock-synth, the-duel-boardgame, forward-boardgame, gelatinous-cube-puzzle)
- [x] 02-03: Migrate Drift with all 7 versions and version selector
- [x] 02-04: Migrate generative-web-art collection and nova4

**Details:**
- Requirements: MIGR-01 through MIGR-10, SPEC-01 through SPEC-04
- Success Criteria:
  1. Each of the 10 projects has been moved to its own repository
  2. Drift repository contains all 7 versions in organized structure with version selector
  3. Generative-web-art repository contains all interactive-art pieces with index page
  4. All project files are preserved as-is without cleanup or modification
  5. Each repository deploys successfully to GitHub Pages
- Completed: 2026-01-19

### Phase 3: Local Cleanup

**Goal**: Original monorepo is cleaned up with only portfolio core remaining
**Depends on**: Phase 2
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 03-01: Verify cloned repos, stage deletions, and commit cleanup

**Details:**
- Requirements: LOCL-01, LOCL-02, LOCL-03
- Success Criteria:
  1. All 10 new repositories are cloned to C:\GitHub Repos\[project-name]\
  2. Migrated project folders are removed from original portfolio repo
  3. Commander-deck-builder folder is completely deleted
  4. Benji-site and archive folders remain in main portfolio repo
- Completed: 2026-01-19

### Phase 4: Portfolio Integration

**Goal**: Portfolio site links to all distributed projects and everything works
**Depends on**: Phase 3
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 04-01: Update portfolio links to GitHub Pages URLs and verify functionality

**Details:**
- Requirements: PORT-01, PORT-02, PORT-03, PORT-04
- Success Criteria:
  1. All project links in index.html point to new GitHub Pages URLs
  2. Benji-site remains functional in main portfolio repo
  3. Archive folder remains accessible in main portfolio repo
  4. All links have been manually tested and work correctly
  5. Original portfolio functionality is completely preserved
- Completed: 2026-01-20

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:**
- None (all phases executed as planned)

**Key Decisions:**
- Decision: Move files as-is without cleanup (Rationale: Faster migration)
- Decision: Keep all Drift versions in one repo (Rationale: Preserve history)
- Decision: Combine interactive-art pieces (Rationale: Related pieces, easier to maintain)
- Decision: Use exact folder names for repos (Rationale: Maintain traceability)
- Decision: Enable Pages from master branch root (Rationale: Simplest deployment)

**Issues Resolved:**
- Successfully migrated 300MB+ repository to distributed architecture
- Reduced main repository size by 95%
- Preserved all portfolio functionality
- Established maintainable project structure

**Issues Deferred:**
- Adding README files to projects (future enhancement)
- Setting up build processes (post-migration)
- Fixing existing tech debt (preserve current state)
- Adding package.json files (future work)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Some projects still have 6000+ line HTML files
- Drift has 7 versions with duplicated code
- No README or documentation in most projects
- No build processes or dependency management
