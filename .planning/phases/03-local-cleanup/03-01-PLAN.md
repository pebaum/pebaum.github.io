<objective>
Clean up the original monorepo by verifying all cloned repositories are complete, staging deletions of migrated project folders, and committing the cleanup.

Purpose: Complete the migration by removing old project folders from the monorepo while preserving portfolio core (benji-site, archive). This finalizes the transition from monolithic to distributed architecture.

Output: Clean monorepo with only portfolio core remaining, all deletions committed to git, all migrated projects verified in separate repositories.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Verify all cloned repositories are complete and functional</name>
  <files>C:/GitHub Repos/*/​.git</files>
  <action>
For each of the 11 cloned repositories, verify integrity and remote connection:

Repositories to verify:
- 4-track-tape-looper
- dnd-dm-screen
- drift
- dualshock-synth
- forward-boardgame
- gelatinous-cube-puzzle
- generative-web-art
- granular-ambient
- nova4
- textscape
- the-duel-boardgame

For each repository:
1. Navigate to repository: `cd "/c/GitHub Repos/[project-name]"`
2. Verify object database integrity: `git fsck`
   - Expected: "Checking object directories: 100% ... done" with no errors
   - Watch for: "missing object", "unreachable object", "hash mismatch"
3. Verify remote connection: `git remote -v`
   - Expected: origin pointing to github.com/pebaum/[project-name].git for both fetch and push
4. Check working directory state: `git status`
   - Expected: "working tree clean" or "Your branch is up to date"
   - Watch for: uncommitted changes or untracked files

If any repository fails verification:
- Document the failure details
- DO NOT proceed with deletions
- Report issue for manual investigation

Use RESEARCH.md patterns from "Verify Clone Integrity" section (lines 232-248).
  </action>
  <verify>
All 11 repositories pass git fsck with no errors, have correct remote URLs, and clean working directories.

Run: `for repo in 4-track-tape-looper dnd-dm-screen drift dualshock-synth forward-boardgame gelatinous-cube-puzzle generative-web-art granular-ambient nova4 textscape the-duel-boardgame; do echo "=== $repo ===" && cd "/c/GitHub Repos/$repo" && git fsck --quiet && git remote -v | grep -q "github.com/pebaum/$repo" && echo "OK" || echo "FAILED"; done`

Expected output: "OK" for all 11 repositories.
  </verify>
  <done>
All 11 cloned repositories verified as complete with:
- Git fsck passes (no missing/unreachable objects)
- Remote URLs correct (github.com/pebaum/[project-name])
- Working directories clean (no uncommitted changes)
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Stage deletions and commit cleanup</name>
  <files>projects/4-track/, projects/ps4-synth/, projects/forward-playground/, projects/gelatinous-cube-puzzle-wip/, projects/nova3-clone-wip/, projects/the-duel/</files>
  <action>
Stage all deletions in git and commit the cleanup:

1. Navigate to monorepo: `cd /c/pebaum.github.io`

2. Check current git status to see unstaged deletions:
   `git status`
   - Expected: ~150+ deleted files across 6 old project folders
   - Deleted folders: 4-track, ps4-synth, forward-playground, gelatinous-cube-puzzle-wip, nova3-clone-wip, the-duel

3. Stage all deletions (files already removed from working directory):
   `git add -A`
   - This stages deletions of already-removed files
   - Use git add -A (not git rm) because files are already deleted from working directory

4. Verify staging is correct:
   `git status`
   - Expected: All deletions in "Changes to be committed" section
   - Watch for: Unintended deletions (benji-site, archive, assets should NOT appear)
   - Watch for: Modifications to files you didn't touch

5. If staging is correct, commit with descriptive message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
chore(03): remove migrated project folders

Removed projects now in separate repositories:
- projects/4-track → 4-track-tape-looper
- projects/ps4-synth → dualshock-synth
- projects/forward-playground → forward-boardgame
- projects/gelatinous-cube-puzzle-wip → gelatinous-cube-puzzle
- projects/nova3-clone-wip → nova4
- projects/the-duel → the-duel-boardgame

All repositories verified as cloned and functional with git fsck.

Satisfies requirements:
- LOCL-02: Remove project folders from original portfolio repo
- LOCL-03: commander-deck-builder verified as non-existent

Portfolio core (benji-site, archive) preserved.

   ```

Use RESEARCH.md patterns from "Stage Deletions Safely" section (lines 250-268).

IMPORTANT: If git status shows ANY unexpected deletions (benji-site, archive, assets, etc.), DO NOT commit. Use `git restore --staged <file>` to unstage those files.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `git status` after commit. Expected output:
- "working tree clean" or similar
- No unstaged changes
- Branch ahead of origin/master by 1 commit (the cleanup commit)

Run `git log -1 --oneline` to verify commit message contains "remove migrated project folders".
  </verify>
  <done>
Git staging area contains only intended deletions (6 old project folders), commit created with descriptive message documenting which folders were removed and where they now exist, working directory is clean.
  </done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Validate final repository state matches requirements</name>
  <files>projects/</files>
  <action>
Verify the final state of the monorepo matches all requirements:

1. List remaining project folders:
   `ls projects/`

   Expected folders (MUST remain):
   - benji-site (requirement PORT-02)
   - dnd-dm-screen
   - drift
   - dualshock-synth
   - 4-track-tape-looper
   - forward-boardgame
   - gelatinous-cube-puzzle
   - granular-ambient
   - interactive-art
   - nova4
   - textscape
   - the-duel-boardgame

   Folders that MUST be gone:
   - 4-track
   - ps4-synth
   - forward-playground
   - gelatinous-cube-puzzle-wip
   - nova3-clone-wip
   - the-duel

2. Verify archive folder remains:
   `ls archive/ >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "archive exists" || echo "archive MISSING"`
   - Expected: "archive exists" (requirement PORT-03)

3. Verify commander-deck-builder is absent:
   `ls commander-deck-builder 2>&1 | grep -q "cannot access" && echo "commander-deck-builder absent" || echo "commander-deck-builder EXISTS"`
   - Expected: "commander-deck-builder absent" (requirement LOCL-03)

4. Check git status is clean:
   `git status`
   - Expected: "working tree clean"
   - No unstaged changes, no untracked files in core directories

5. Document any discrepancies between expected and actual state.

Use RESEARCH.md patterns from "List Remaining Folders After Cleanup" section (lines 299-312).
  </action>
  <verify>
Run the following checks:
1. `ls projects/ | wc -l` returns 12 (12 folders remain)
2. `ls projects/ | grep -E "^(4-track|ps4-synth|forward-playground|gelatinous-cube-puzzle-wip|nova3-clone-wip|the-duel)$"` returns nothing (old folders gone)
3. `ls projects/ | grep benji-site` returns "benji-site" (core preserved)
4. `ls archive/` succeeds (archive preserved)
5. `git status` shows "working tree clean"
  </verify>
  <done>
Final repository state validated:
- 12 project folders remain (new full-name projects + benji-site)
- 6 old project folders removed (abbreviated names and -wip suffixes)
- Portfolio core preserved (benji-site, archive exist)
- Commander-deck-builder verified absent
- Git working directory clean
- All requirements LOCL-01, LOCL-02, LOCL-03 satisfied
  </done>

After all tasks complete, verify Phase 3 success criteria from ROADMAP.md:

1. All 10 new repositories are cloned to C:\GitHub Repos\[project-name]\ ✓
   - Verified with git fsck for all 11 repos (10 migrated + the-duel-boardgame)

2. Migrated project folders are removed from original portfolio repo ✓
   - Deleted and committed: 4-track, ps4-synth, forward-playground, gelatinous-cube-puzzle-wip, nova3-clone-wip, the-duel

3. Commander-deck-builder folder is completely deleted ✓
   - Verified as non-existent (requirement LOCL-03)

4. Benji-site and archive folders remain in main portfolio repo ✓
   - Both verified to exist after cleanup

Requirements covered:
- LOCL-01: Clone all new repos to C:\GitHub Repos\[project-name]\ ✓
- LOCL-02: Remove project folders from original portfolio repo ✓
- LOCL-03: Delete commander-deck-builder folder completely ✓
</verification>

<success_criteria>
Phase 3 complete when:

1. All 11 cloned repositories pass integrity verification (git fsck, remote URLs correct)
2. Old project folders (4-track, ps4-synth, forward-playground, gelatinous-cube-puzzle-wip, nova3-clone-wip, the-duel) are deleted and deletion committed to git
3. New project folders (full names: 4-track-tape-looper, dualshock-synth, etc.) remain in projects/
4. Portfolio core folders (benji-site, archive) remain in monorepo
5. Commander-deck-builder verified as non-existent
6. Git working directory is clean with no unstaged changes
7. Git commit created documenting cleanup with mapping of old → new repository names
