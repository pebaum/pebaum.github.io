### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Keep all Drift versions in one repo (preserve history, allow version comparison)
- Combine interactive-art pieces into generative-web-art repo (related small pieces, easier to maintain)
- Keep benji-site in main repo (part of main portfolio, not standalone project)
