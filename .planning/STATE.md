## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Move files as-is without cleanup (faster migration, fix issues post-migration)
- Keep all Drift versions in one repo (preserve history, allow version comparison)
- Combine interactive-art pieces into generative-web-art repo (related small pieces, easier to maintain)
- Keep benji-site in main repo (part of main portfolio, not standalone project)

**From 01-01 (Repository Setup):**
- Use exact project folder names from monorepo as repository names
- Enable GitHub Pages from master branch / root path
- Skip README initialization (content migrated in Phase 2)
- All repositories are public for GitHub Pages hosting

### Pending Todos
