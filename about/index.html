    <h1>About the Fire Keeper</h1>

    <h2>Welcome, Traveler</h2>
    <p>
        You have found your way to this digital shrine, a place where creativity and code intertwine.
        This space is a collection of experiments, projects, and explorations in interactive media,
        generative music, and digital art.
    </p>

    <h2>The Keeper's Purpose</h2>
    <p>
        Like the Fire Keeper tends the bonfire, this portfolio tends to the flames of creativity.
        Each NPC you encounter in the shrine represents a different facet of creative work:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Bard (♪)</strong> - Generative music and ambient soundscapes</li>
        <li><strong>The Blacksmith (⚒)</strong> - Miscellaneous coding projects and experiments</li>
        <li><strong>The Painter (✎)</strong> - Interactive art and visual experiences</li>
        <li><strong>The Knight (♞)</strong> - Professional work and portfolio</li>
        <li><strong>The Librarian (📚)</strong> - Writing and documentation</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>
        To reach across the void, seek me through the usual channels of communication.
        Or simply return to the shrine and explore its secrets.
    </p>

    <h2>The Secret</h2>
    <p>
        They say a bronze key lies hidden somewhere in the shrine, waiting to unlock something
        that was meant to remain concealed. But perhaps some secrets are meant to be found...
