# Drift v6 — Spiral Collapse

A 5-minute generative ambient composition that mirrors the lifecycle of a universe.

## Concept

Music emerges from a single root note (singularity), spirals outward through expanding arms of complexity, reaches peak density, then gradually collapses back into silence—returning to the root note from which it began.

## The Journey (5 Minutes)

### Phase 1: Genesis (0:00 - 0:24)
- A single root drone emerges from silence
- The core pulses gently at the center of the galaxy
- Minimal complexity, maximum stillness

### Phase 2: Expansion (0:24 - 1:45)  
- Spiral arms begin to emerge from the core
- Each arm represents a different musical voice:
  - **Melody Arm** (blue): High register melodic fragments
  - **Harmony Arm** (pink): Chord progressions
  - **Texture Arm** (green): Bell-like timbres
  - **Rhythm Arm** (orange): Low rhythmic pulses
  - **Ambient Arm** (purple): Long sustained pads
- Notes spread outward like stars forming in a galaxy

### Phase 3: Complexity (1:45 - 3:15)
- Maximum musical density
- All arms fully active
- Extended scale (full natural minor)
- Nodes cover the maximum area of the visualization
- The galaxy is at its most alive

### Phase 4: Entropy (3:15 - 4:15)
- Activity begins to decline
- Nodes start drifting toward center
- Musical events become less frequent
- The universe begins cooling

### Phase 5: Collapse (4:15 - 4:51)
- Rapid reduction in complexity
- Arms retract toward the core
- Most voices fall silent
- Visual nodes converge on center

### Phase 6: Singularity (4:51 - 5:00)
- Only the root drone remains
- All nodes collapse to center
- Return to the single point from which everything emerged
- Silence

## Visualization

The galaxy map shows:
- **Central Core**: The root note, always present, pulsing
- **Spiral Arms**: Each arm represents a voice type
- **Nodes**: Individual musical events, positioned along spiral paths
- **Connections**: Lines showing the relationships between notes
- **Glow**: Nodes pulse when their corresponding sound plays

As complexity increases, more nodes appear and spread outward. During collapse, nodes migrate back toward the center and fade.

## Technical Notes

- Built with Web Audio API
- Synthesis: Multiple detuned oscillators for warmth
- Reverb: Convolution-based for spatial depth
- Scales: Minor pentatonic (simple) → Natural minor (complex)
- Root note: Randomized between C2-G2 on each run
- Canvas-based real-time visualization

## Usage

1. Click **BEGIN** to start the composition
2. Watch the galaxy form and collapse over 5 minutes
3. Click **RESTART** to experience it again with a new root note

## Philosophy

Like the universe itself—born from nothing, expanding into infinite complexity, then eventually succumbing to entropy and returning to stillness—this piece explores the beauty of impermanence. Every performance is unique, yet every performance ends the same way: in silence.
