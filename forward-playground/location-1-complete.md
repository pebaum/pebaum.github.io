## MATH SUMMARY

### Damage Available
| Source | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| 5 Beasts | ~19 HP |
| 1 Hollow | ~7 HP |
| 3 Pits | ~7 HP (avg) |
| 1 Terror | 6 HP (if taking damage) |
| **TOTAL** | **~39 HP** |

### Healing Available
| Source | Amount |
|--------|--------|
| 2 Items | 9 HP |
| 1 Blessing | 10 HP |
| 3 Lux | 15 HP (if all spent on healing) |
| **TOTAL** | **34 HP** |

### Expected Outcome
**Perfect play (using all Lux for healing):**
- Start: 20 HP
- Damage: ~35 HP (not all cards drawn)
- Healing: 34 HP
- **End: 19 HP**

**Realistic play (using some Lux for rerolls/peeks):**
- Start: 20 HP
- Damage: ~35 HP
- Healing: ~24 HP (saving 1-2 Lux for utility)
- **End: 9-12 HP** ✓

### Balance Verdict
✅ **Balanced for 20 HP start**
- Survival requires smart choices and resource management
- Player has agency (Equipment choice, Terror choice, Lux spending)
- Tension without being punishing
- Multiple viable strategies

## Playtest Questions

Before moving to Location 2 design:

1. **Is Snare too punishing?** Does blocking Lux spending feel fair?
2. **Is Blessing powerful enough?** Should it give Lux as well as healing?
3. **Do Equipment choices matter?** Is there a clear best choice or do they serve different playstyles?
4. **Are Pits interesting?** Does the roll-for-successes mechanic feel good?
5. **Is Terror choice meaningful?** Or do players always pick one option?
6. **Combat length:** Do 7 HP enemies feel too long (10 rounds)?
7. **Difficulty curve:** Should Location 1 be easier as a tutorial?

## Next Steps

1. Print and playtest these 19 cards
2. Track actual HP totals across 5-10 playthroughs
3. Adjust numbers based on data
4. Once balanced, add flavor text and art direction
5. Design Location 2 with similar process (slightly harder)
