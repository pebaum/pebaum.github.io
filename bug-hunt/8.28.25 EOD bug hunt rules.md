# Bug Hunt — Rules (Draft)

This is a first playable draft distilled from the 8.28.25 design notes. Assumptions are marked with [ASSUMPTION] and questions with [Q] for your confirmation.

## Overview

Bug Hunt is a fast, competitive/co-op forest hunt played over three timed Days. Everyone plays in real time—no turns. Move across a hex jungle map, engage giant bugs, manage your Hunter’s health, and score points by collecting bug tokens.

Players: 1–4 
Play time: ??? 
Days: 3 (timed rounds)

## Components (prototype)

- Hex jungle map with terrain hexes costing 1, 2, or 3 movement
- Bug tokens by Size (Small, Medium, Large)
- Hunter pawns/standees and 10 HP tracker per player
- 1d6 die
- Timer (phone ok)

## Objective

Have the highest total points after Day 3.

## Setup

1. Place the map. Everyone starts at the Village start tile.
2. Each player chooses a Hunter token and sets HP to 10.
3. Prepare the Bug Pool: Put Small ×10, Medium ×5, Large ×3 tokens in a cup. (Most Small, some Medium, few Large.)
4. Random Pour: Shake the cup and gently scatter tokens across the map surface. Off‑map tokens are re‑dropped; overlapping tokens need to be nudged apart.
5. Give each player 0 starting points.
6. Set a Day timer for 3 minutes.

## Day Structure (three Days)

1. Start the 3‑minute timer.
2. Free‑for‑all: all players act simultaneously. Roll to move, spend movement, and fight bugs in real time. There are no turns.
3. When the timer ends, all actions stop immediately. Score any bugs you’ve already defeated.
4. Reset for next Day.

## Real‑Time Play

Players act simultaneously. On your go (any time during the Day):

1. Roll to Move: roll 1d6; you have that many movement points for this move.
2. Spend movement to move to adjacent hexes; each hex has a movement cost of 1, 2, or 3.
3. If you enter a hex with a bug, you must stop and Fight it; any unspent movement is lost.

You cannot move through a hex containing another player’s current fight. You may pass through other players otherwise.

Claiming a Bug (simultaneous arrivals): The first pawn to fully enter the bug’s hex claims the fight. If truly simultaneous, both players roll 1d6; highest claims (reroll ties).

## Fighting Bugs

To fight, your pawn must be on the bug’s hex.

Basic Combat — Size Target Number: Roll 1d6 repeatedly until you succeed. On any roll of 1, you take 1 damage (Sting).

- Small: hit on 4+
- Medium: hit on 5+
- Large: hit on 6+

On a successful hit, the bug is defeated immediately; take its token and points. On a failure, roll again as long as the Day timer is running.

After defeating a bug, immediately take its token and gain its points. Roll again for your next move when ready.

## Player Health and Knockout

- Each Hunter starts at 10 HP.
- If your HP is reduced to 0, you’re Knocked Out: immediately return to the Village/Camp at full HP. Your current action ends; there’s no further penalty and you keep all collected bug tokens. Resume movement right away from the Village with a fresh roll.


## Bug List (Basic)

| Size  | Points |
|-------|--------|
| Small | 1      |
| Medium| 2      |
| Large | 3      |

## Scoring

- Keep collected bug tokens face up; their points count immediately.
- Points carry over between Days.
- Highest total after Day 3 wins. Ties: most Large bugs collected, then most total bugs. [ASSUMPTION]

<!-- Endgame and detailed roster moved to Appendix -->

<!-- Variants moved to Appendix -->

## Examples (quick)

- Move: You roll a 5. You travel a 1‑cost, 1‑cost, then 3‑cost hex (1+1+3=5) and end on a Medium bug. You must fight.
- Fight (Basic): Medium needs 5+. You roll 1 (Sting: take 1 damage), then 6 (success) — you defeat it and take 2 points.
- KO: You hit 0 HP; you reset to Village/Camp immediately. No token loss or skipped turn; resume next round.

## Open Questions for You

1. Re‑pour timing: end of each Day, or only to start a new game?
2. Map size/layout target for the “really big hex map” (e.g., radius R, or ~12×12 equivalent)?
3. Terrain presentation: how do you want to mark 1/2/3‑cost hexes on the map (icons, colors, or tile types)?

Once you confirm these, I’ll lock defaults, tune the appendix, and add a printable map and player aids.

## Appendix: Optional Systems

### Variants and Advanced Rules

- Tougher Progression: As Days advance, increase Sting severity by +1 on Day 2 and +2 on Day 3.
- Refill by Re‑Pour: At the end of each Day, scoop all remaining bugs into the cup, add new tokens if desired, shake, and re‑pour to refresh distribution.
- Team-Up Assist: Two players sharing a bug’s hex may alternate rolls; both suffer Sting on their own 1s. Only one player claims the token; decide before the fight.
- Terrain Hazards: Rivers or cliffs cost 3 movement to enter and cannot be ended upon unless you defeat a bug there.

### Items and Shop

Between Days, you may buy items with points you earned. Suggested costs and effects:

- Spear (3 pts): +1 damage vs Armored bugs (or +2 with Mode A damage).
- Bow (3 pts): +1 damage vs Flying bugs (or +2 with Mode A damage).
- Club (2 pts): Reroll one miss per fight vs Ground bugs.
- Net (2 pts): Ignore Path/Forest cost for the final space entering a bug’s space.
- Smoke Bomb (2 pts, one-use): Evade one bug you share a space with; you may move on without fighting.
- Poison (4 pts, one-use): Instantly defeat a Small or Medium bug. Large are immune.

### Hunter Type Advantages

At setup, each Hunter chooses one specialty: Ground, Flying, or Armored. Gain +1 effective damage (Mode B) or +2 damage (Mode A) versus that type.

### Endgame: Queen Bee (Finale)

At the start of Day 3, spawn the Queen Bee at the Hive (marked space). All players may attack the Queen cooperatively in addition to normal hunts.

- Queen Bee (prototype): HP 40, Sting 6, Category Flying/Armored.
- Splash Sting: When any player rolls a 1 against the Queen, all adjacent players also take 1 Sting damage.
- Reward: Defeating the Queen grants a +5 bonus to every participating player.
