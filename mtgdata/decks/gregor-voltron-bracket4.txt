# DECK STRATEGY NOTES:

## Your Priorities Explained:

### PRIORITY 1: PROTECTION (18 cards)
Gregor must survive. Period. The deck runs:
- **4 Indestructible sources** - Darksteel Plate, Mithril Coat, Kaldra Compleat, Gift of Immortality
- **3 Hexproof/Shroud** - Lightning Greaves, Swiftfoot Boots, Diplomatic Immunity  
- **7 Counterspells/Instants** - Free counters and instant protection
- **4 Repeatable Protection** - Mother/Giver of Runes, Selfless Spirit, Alseid

### PRIORITY 2: UNBLOCKABLE (12 cards)
Skulk helps, but once Gregor gets big, you need true unblockable:
- **Auras:** Aqueous Form, Spirit Mantle, Unquestioned Authority, Holy Mantle
- **Equipment:** Whispersilk Cloak, Trailblazer's Boots, Prowler's Helm
- **Lands:** Rogue's Passage, Access Tunnel
- **Cantrips:** Shadow Rift, Slip Through Space, Distortion Strike (also draw/rebound!)

### PRIORITY 3: BOARD CONTROL (14 cards)
Wipe the board, keep your commander:
- **Slash the Ranks** - THE perfect card, destroys everything except commanders
- **Single Combat / Divine Reckoning** - You choose to keep Gregor
- **Tragic Arrogance** - YOU decide what opponents keep
- **Mass Calcify** - Gregor is white, survives automatically
- **Slaughter the Strong** - Base 1-power Gregor always survives

### PRIORITY 4: POWER VIA COUNTERS (15 cards)
Counters are permanent and resilient:
- **The Ozolith** - Saves counters if Gregor dies!
- **Hardened Scales / Branching Evolution** - Double your counters
- **Luminarch Aspirant** - Free +1/+1 every combat
- **Grateful Apparition** - Proliferate on combat damage
- **Resourceful Defense** - Move counters when creatures die

## Key Combos:
1. **Gregor + The Ozolith** - If Gregor dies, counters go to Ozolith, return when he comes back
2. **Gregor + Duelist's Heritage + counters** - Double strike = draw twice your power in cards
3. **Gregor + True Conviction** - Double strike + lifelink, massive card draw + life
4. **Luminarch Aspirant + Grateful Apparition** - Exponential counter growth

## Mulligan Priorities:
1. 3+ lands including both colors
2. Early ramp (Sol Ring, signets)
3. Protection piece (Greaves, Mom, counterspell)
4. Unblockable effect or board wipe

## Weaknesses to Watch:
- **Sacrifice effects** - Gregor must be on board (run counters to stop Fleshbag etc)
- **Exile removal** - Indestructible doesn't help
- **Mass bounce** - Counters stay but auras/equipment fall off (Ozolith helps!)

## COMMANDER-SAFE BOARD WIPES:

| Card | What It Does | Why Gregor Survives |
|------|--------------|---------------------|
| Slash the Ranks | Destroys all except commanders | Gregor IS a commander! |
| Single Combat | Each player keeps 1 creature | Choose Gregor |
| Divine Reckoning | Each player keeps 1 creature | Choose Gregor |
| Tragic Arrogance | You choose what everyone keeps | You control it |
| Cataclysmic Gearhulk | Keep 1 of each type | Gregor + 1 equipment |
| Mass Calcify | Destroys non-white | Gregor is white |
| Slaughter the Strong | Kills high power | Base 1-power survives |
| Austere Command | Modal choices | Skip small creatures mode |

## COUNTER SYNERGIES:

| Card | Effect | Synergy |
|------|--------|---------|
| **The Ozolith** | Stores counters from dying creatures | Insurance policy! |
| **Hardened Scales** | +1 counter whenever counters added | Doubles growth rate |
| **Branching Evolution** | Double counters placed | Exponential growth |
| **Grateful Apparition** | Proliferate on damage | Every hit = more counters |
| **Resourceful Defense** | Move counters from dying creatures | Backup for Ozolith |

Total: 99 cards (check lands count)
