# The Council of Four — "Settlers of Catan" Economic Control

## Commander

- *Whenever a player casts their second spell during their turn, you create a 2/2 white Knight creature token.*

---

## Deck Philosophy: "The Trading Post"

This deck plays like **Settlers of Catan at a Magic table**. You're not the aggressive player hoarding resources—you're the friendly merchant who benefits from *everyone's* prosperity while quietly taxing every transaction. 

**The Economic Control Strategy:**
1. **Let opponents play the game** — You WANT them drawing cards and casting spells
2. **Tax every transaction** — Rhystic Study, Smothering Tithe, Esper Sentinel
3. **Benefit from their success** — Council triggers, Smuggler's Share, Trouble in Pairs
4. **Subtle control** — Aura of Silence, Blind Obedience, Propaganda
5. **Inevitable victory** — Approach of the Second Sun, Expropriate, **Maze's End**, **Mechanized Production**

You're the player who says "Sure, go ahead!" while quietly accumulating insurmountable advantage.

### The Maze's End Sub-Theme
Your mana base includes **11 Gates + Maze's End**. While you're taxing opponents and building your economic engine, you're also quietly activating Maze's End to return Gates and search for new ones. When you control 10 Gates with different names + Maze's End, you simply win. **Expedition Map** and **Tolaria West** can tutor directly for Maze's End, while **Guild Summit** turns your Gates into card draw.

## The "Settlers of Catan" Gameplay Pattern

### Early Game (Turns 1-4): "Building Your Roads"
- Deploy mana rocks
- Land your tax pieces (Rhystic Study, Esper Sentinel, Smothering Tithe)
- Establish pillowfort effects
- **DO NOT** appear threatening

### Mid Game (Turns 5-10): "Trading and Building"
- Deploy Council of Four
- Add group hug effects (Howling Mine) to accelerate EVERYONE
- You benefit from their activity far more than they realize:
  - They draw? You draw (Council) + Treasure (Tithe) + Tax (Rhystic)
  - They cast? You get Knights (Council) + Tax (Esper)
  - They attack someone else? You draw (Mangara, Trouble in Pairs)

### Late Game (Turns 10+): "Claiming Victory"
- You should have:
  - 20+ cards seen this game
  - Dozens of treasures
  - Army of Knights
  - Full grip of cards
- Resolve **Approach of the Second Sun**, then find it again with massive card draw
- Or resolve **Expropriate** for immediate domination
- Or alpha strike with Memorial-buffed Knights

---

## Key Synergy Chains

### "The Perfect Engine"
```
Smothering Tithe + Howling Mine + Rhystic Study + Council of Four
= Every opponent's turn:
  - They draw (Howling Mine trigger) → Council draws you a card
  - They might not pay for Tithe → You get Treasure
  - They cast a spell → Maybe don't pay for Rhystic → You draw
  - They cast second spell → Council makes a Knight
  - YOU: +2-3 cards, +1-3 Treasures, +1 Knight PER OPPONENT PER TURN
```

### "The Maze's End Path"
```
Turn 1-3: Play Gates naturally (they tap for colors you need)
Turn 4+: Deploy Maze's End
→ Each turn: Tap Maze's End → Return to hand → Search for a new Gate
→ Expedition Map can find Maze's End if you don't draw it
→ Tolaria West transmutes for Maze's End ({0} mana value)
→ Weathered Wayfarer repeatable-finds Gates when behind on lands
→ Guild Summit: Each Gate entering draws a card
→ Gond Gate makes all your other Gates enter UNTAPPED
→ Win: Control 10 Gates with different names + activate Maze's End = GG
```

### "The Mechanized Production Treasure Win"
```
You have Smothering Tithe in play making Treasures
Cast Mechanized Production on any Treasure token
→ Each upkeep: Make a copy of that Treasure
→ You already have 3+ Treasures from Tithe = 4+ now
→ Opponents keep drawing cards (Howling Mine, etc.)
→ You keep getting Treasures
→ Upkeep: 8+ Treasures with the same name = YOU WIN
This can happen in 2-3 turns after casting Production!
```

### "The Friendly Counter"
```
Arcane Denial counters their spell
→ They draw 2 cards on their upkeep
→ Council triggers (their second card) = You draw
→ They might cast something with those cards = More triggers
→ You said "sorry I had to counter that" while profiting
```

### "The Approach Line"
```
Turn X: Cast Approach of the Second Sun (goes 7th from top)
→ You have Teferi's Ageless Insight + Howling Mine + Rhystic Study
→ Every turn cycle draws you 4-8 cards
→ Turn X+2 or X+3: Cast Approach again = Win
```

### "The Expropriate Finale"
```
You've accumulated 15+ treasures from Smothering Tithe
Cast Expropriate for {7}{U}{U} (or less with treasures to spare)
→ Each opponent votes Money (you take a permanent) or Time (you take a turn)
→ Either way, you're taking 3+ extra turns or their best permanents
→ Swing with Knights or cast Approach during extra turns
```

## Political Notes

**Things to say at the table:**

- "Go ahead, I don't mind" *(while Council/Rhystic trigger)*
- "I'm not a threat, I'm just drawing cards" *(while accumulating 20 cards)*
- "Feel free to attack them, not me" *(behind Propaganda + Prison)*
- "Would you like to pay the 1?" *(they usually won't)*
- "Sure, resolve your spell!" *(triggers Knight production)*

**The key insight:** You WANT opponents to play Magic. Every action they take enriches you. Don't stop them—tax them.

---

## Budget Considerations

**Most Expensive Cards:**
- Smothering Tithe (~$40)
- Rhystic Study (~$35)  
- Teferi's Protection (~$30)
- Consecrated Sphinx (~$25)
- Cyclonic Rift (~$25)
- Expropriate (~$25)
- Fierce Guardianship (~$20)

**Budget Swaps:**
- Smothering Tithe → Archaeomancer's Map
- Expropriate → Time Warp or Temporal Mastery
- Consecrated Sphinx → Windfall
- Cyclonic Rift → Flood of Tears
- Fierce Guardianship → Saw It Coming

---

## Why This Stays Bracket 3

**What makes it Bracket 3:**
- No fast mana (Mana Crypt, Chrome Mox, etc.)
- No infinite combos
- No hard locks (Stasis, Winter Orb, etc.)
- Taxes slow opponents but don't prevent them from playing
- Win conditions require time and board development

**What keeps it from Bracket 2:**
- Rhystic Study + Smothering Tithe engine is powerful
- Expropriate is a "game changer" card
- Fierce Guardianship is free interaction
- Strong pillowfort makes you hard to interact with

## The Catan Parallel

| Catan Concept | This Deck's Version |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Building settlements | Deploying tax enchantments |
| Trading with others | Letting opponents play (and taxing them) |
| Longest Road | **Maze's End — building toward 10 Gates** |
| Robber | Aura of Silence, Aven Mindcensor |
| Development Cards | Holding up interaction |
| Largest Army | Knight tokens from Council |
| Ports (2:1 trades) | Smothering Tithe conversion rate |
| 10 Victory Points | Approach of the Second Sun |
| **Resource monopoly** | **Mechanized Production (8 Treasures)** |

You win not by crushing opponents, but by **benefiting from every transaction** until you've accumulated inevitable victory.

---

## Resiliency Features

This deck is built to **recover and persist**:

1. **Multiple Win Conditions:** Approach, Expropriate, **Maze's End**, **Mechanized Production**, Token Beats, Entreat
2. **Land-Based Wins:** Maze's End is VERY hard to interact with (land destruction is rare)
3. **Treasure Wins:** Mechanized Production with Smothering Tithe is fast and unexpected
4. **Enchantment Recursion:** Hall of Heliod's Generosity
5. **Spell Recursion:** Mystic Sanctuary
6. **Card Advantage:** You'll always have more cards than opponents
7. **Redundancy:** Multiple tax effects, multiple pillowfort pieces
8. **Protection:** Teferi's Protection, Flawless Maneuver, Counterspells
9. **Land Tutors:** Expedition Map, Weathered Wayfarer, Tolaria West transmute

Even if they destroy your Rhystic Study, you have Esper Sentinel, Mystic Remora, Smothering Tithe, Trouble in Pairs, Mangara, Smuggler's Share...

---

## Maze's End Gate Selection Rationale

We run **11 Gates with different names** to ensure we can hit the 10-Gate threshold even if one gets destroyed:

| Gate | Why It's Included |
|------|-------------------|
| **Gond Gate** | MVP—makes all OTHER Gates enter untapped! |
| **Heap Gate** | Creates Treasures—feeds Mechanized Production |
| **Gate to Seatower** | Scry 1 when it enters—card selection |
| **Basilisk Gate** | Buffs creatures—makes Knights threatening |
| **Baldur's Gate** | Flexible mana based on what you spent |
| **Sea Gate** | Blue mana |
| **Citadel Gate** | Counts as any basic land type for fixing |
| **Azorius Guildgate** | W/U dual |
| **Gateway Plaza** | Any color (pay 1) |
| **Black Dragon Gate** | Colorless + any color |
| **Cliffgate** | R/W but colorless identity—legal in Azorius |

Plus **Plaza of Harmony** (not a Gate, but produces any Gate color and gains life).

*"In the game of thrones, you win or you die. In the game of Catan, you trade until you win. In this deck, you trade until you control all the gates."*
