# Ishai & Tymna: Esper Control Partners

## Commander Analysis

### Ishai, Ojutai Dragonspeaker {2}{W}{U}
- **Stats:** 1/1 Flying
- **Ability:** Whenever an opponent casts a spell, put a +1/+1 counter on Ishai
- **Partner**

### Tymna the Weaver {1}{W}{B}
- **Stats:** 2/2 Lifelink
- **Ability:** At the beginning of your postcombat main phase, pay X life to draw X cards (where X = opponents dealt combat damage this turn)
- **Partner**

---

## Strategic Framework (Based on Unified Theory)

This pairing perfectly embodies the **"Win from Second Place"** philosophy:

1. **Tymna draws cards quietly** - She only triggers when you deal combat damage, so she looks less threatening than Rhystic Study
2. **Ishai grows passively** - Your opponents make Ishai bigger by just playing Magic
3. **Low initial threat assessment** - Neither commander is immediately scary, letting you develop quietly
4. **Excellent political positioning** - You can politely attack different opponents to maximize Tymna draws while spreading damage politically

## Strategic Playlines

### Early Game (Turns 1-4)
1. Deploy cheap unblockables (Changeling Outcast, Slither Blade)
2. Cast Tymna on turn 2-3, start swinging with unblockables
3. Draw cards off Tymna by attacking different opponents (political!)
4. Ramp with signets/talismans
5. **Don't cast Ishai yet** - you want opponents to tap out first

### Mid Game (Turns 5-10)
1. Cast Ishai once opponents are developing their boards
2. Watch Ishai grow passively as opponents cast spells
3. Use removal surgically - remove threats to the whole table
4. Protect your board with boots/greaves
5. Stay in "Second Place" - let someone else be the Archenemy

### Closing (Turns 10+)
1. When board is right, make Ishai unblockable with Rogue's Passage/Thassa/Aqueous Form
2. Swing with enormous flying threat + equipped creatures
3. Or go for Thassa's Oracle + Demonic Consultation if needed
4. Cyclonic Rift + attack for lethal on clear board

---

## Political Notes

**Good Political Plays:**
- "I'll attack Player A with my 1/1 unblockable and you with Tymna - we both have issues with their board"
- "I'll save my counter for a real threat, not your value piece"
- Let Ishai grow but don't attack with it until you're ready to kill

**Avoid:**
- Turn 1 Sol Ring → Turn 2 Ishai (makes you Archenemy immediately)
- Using removal on minor threats (save for real problems)
- Attacking the same player repeatedly with Tymna (spread the damage politically)

---

## Budget Considerations

### Cards to Cut if Budget is Tight:
- Fetch lands → Replace with more basics + Evolving Wilds/Terramorphic
- Fierce Guardianship → Replace with Negate
- Deadly Rollick → Replace with Doom Blade
- Smothering Tithe → Replace with Mind Stone
- Sword of Feast and Famine → Replace with Whispersilk Cloak
- Demonic Tutor → Replace with Diabolic Tutor

### Budget Total Estimate:
- Full list: ~$500-700
- Budget version: ~$100-150

---

## Upgrade Path

### Power Level Increases:
1. Add **Mana Crypt** for more fast mana
2. Add **Force of Will** for free countermagic
3. Add **Mana Drain** for tempo
4. Add **Original Dual Lands** for perfect mana
5. Add **Jeweled Lotus** for explosive commander turns

---

*This deck embodies the Unified Theory principle: "Win from second place." Let opponents make Ishai huge while you quietly draw cards with Tymna. Strike when the table has exhausted itself fighting each other.*
