============================================================

Being adaptable is key in Magic. Knowing how to defend yourself is useful, as is knowing how to be aggressive and close out a game. However, you can't make full use of these skills if you don't know when you ought to be employing each one.

Do you want to play offense or defense? It's important to ask this question frequently, through all stages from deckbuilding to sideboarding to mulligans and gameplay. The problem, however, is that many players make their choice early on, and never stop to reevaluate.

The key is to be able to reconsider and adjust your game plan as you go. Going into a particularly tough matchup, you might realize that your normal strategy isn't going to work and that you'll have to adapt. Other times, you'll have to make similar evaluations as the texture of the game begins to change. The concept that players should adjust their overarching strategy is called role assignment.

Way back in 1999, magic luminary Mike Flores posed perhaps the most poignant question in all of Magic theory, " Who's the Beatdown ?" His question is, in other words, which player ought to be attacking and which player ought to be defending? What is your role in the game?

Answering this question correctly won't guarantee victory. However, answering wrong - or worse yet, failing to ask at all - will most certainly lead to disaster. Do not try to race against an opponent who can output damage faster than you. Do not try to outlast an opponent with a stronger late game. Identify whether you ought to be forcing the action or trying to extend the game, and act accordingly.

## Late-Game Advantage

The question of who's the beatdown is tied closely to inevitability. If one player has inevitability, the opponent most certainly ought to be "the beatdown," because if they aren't, the game will steadily move toward a state where they can no longer win.

### What is Inevitability in MTG?

Learn to always come out on top.

True inevitability doesn't exist in every matchup (imagine a mirror match between two similar decks, for example). However, you should always check if one player is likely to have an advantage as the game drags on. Maybe you've sideboarded in some haymaker cards, and you feel that you should prolong the game to give yourself more chances to draw one. In such a case, you'll be slightly more inclined to play defense.

This will come up often in Limited, where the presence of a bomb rare might make you want to drag the game out. It can also pull you in the opposite direction. If you lost Game 1 to your opponent's Unstable Glyphbridge , you might decide that you have to close out Game 2 before they draw it, in which case you'll have to play the role of "the beatdown."

Also look at the other side of the coin and ask which player is capable of winning faster. This player will have an edge in the early game and will virtually force the opponent into playing defensively.

Identify the point in the game where your advantage is greatest, and center your strategy around it.

## Limited

In some cases, "who's the beatdown?" is an easy question; one deck will be clearly faster and more aggressive than the other. It gets more complicated when the two decks look similar, and when role assignment can be fluid as the game progresses.

Limited is a clear example, as most Limited decks feature elements of both offense and defense. You and your opponent's deck will likely have creatures on a balanced mana curve with removal and other spells to support them. In such cases, you'll have to decide your role not only based on the matchup between the two decks, but also on what cards are drawn and how the board develops. You may have to adjust your plan as the game progresses.

## Mirror Matches

It also comes up in Constructed that decks of comparable speed will be forced to play against one another. In Standard, Mono-Red and Toxic are both fast decks designed for racing. At what point will one player have to reign in the aggression and start leaving back blockers?

An even easier example is a mirror match - i.e., when both players are playing with the same deck archetype. Mono-Red players aren't used to blocking or voluntarily trading off their creatures, but in a mirror match, they might be forced to do so.

## Play vs. Draw

In these borderline situations, what factors contribute to role assignment? The clearest one is simply which player goes first. Mirroring your opponent's plays when you're on the draw is typically a losing battle. In order to "break serve," the player on the draw will have to slow down the game. Their goal is to survive to a later stage, where the disadvantage of going second won't feel quite as harsh.

In more concrete terms, when Johnny is on the play, his Etching of Kumano will unload damage faster than Jenny's Etching of Kumano when she's on the draw. Jenny should identify that a pure race won't end in her favor, and should consider blocking to trade creatures.

## What Do Your Cards Do Best?

The second factor is what cards each player happens to draw. Whose opening hand is better? Which player misses a land drop? Which player draws a bunch of creatures and which draws a bunch of removal spells?

Standard Golgari can present an aggressive clock when it curves out with , Glissa Sunslayer and Sheoldred, the Apocalypse . On the other hand, it can also grind out games when its draw is heavier on removal spells and Liliana of the Veil . When you sleeve up Golgari, you should be prepared to play either kind of game based on the matchup, who's going first, and the texture of your draw.

Never be afraid to press an early advantage. Sometimes your opponent's draft deck might be generally faster and more aggressive than yours, but that doesn't eliminate the chance of you having a faster draw than your opponent! If you have a one-drop, a two-drop and a three-drop creature while your opponent plays nothing in the early turns, it might be best to take on the role of the aggressor and try to keep your opponent on the back foot so they can't turn the tables on you.

Then again, once your opponent starts playing creatures, it might be right to switch back to playing defense!

## Building Your Deck to Be Flexible

The major strength of midrange decks, like Golgari, is their flexibility. Midrange decks can play a control game against fast decks and can play the role of the aggressor against slow decks. Many factors contribute to this quality, including a balanced game plan and a sideboard that helps hone the deck for any matchup. However, a lot of it comes down to individual card choices as well.

Some cards have flexibility built into them. Midrange decks strive to find cards that play effective defense, but can also turn on their opponents when the time comes to go for the throat.

Blossoming Tortoise is a very cool midrange creature. When it comes down it generates card advantage and ramps your mana. But then, when you're ready to start attacking aggressively, it helps mobilize all of your Restless Cottages and Mishra's Foundries to help close out the game!

Versatile answer cards are also great. Having control over the creatures on the board means being able to slow down your opponent's offense or take out a blocker in order to keep attacking.

Burn spells are great for aggressive and midrange decks alike, and they're at their best when you master the concept of role assignment. They're capable of stopping an attacker, taking out a blocker or going straight after your opponent's life total. When you know which choice to make, burn spells will help you win games that otherwise might have slipped away from you.

Sideboards are also tremendously helpful in positioning yourself in the appropriate role. When you face a slow, controlling deck, you can swap your defensive cards and removal spells for faster or more resilient threats. When you face Mono-Red, you can change into a defensive deck designed to handle a creature onslaught.

Remember that there can be fluidity in role assignment. The way your two decks match up matters a lot, but sometimes it can be outweighed by the cards drawn in a particular game. Your deck might be aggressive, but if your opponent has a fast start you simply have to play defense. You never know what might happen in a game of Magic, and the more flexible you can be, the more unexpected opportunities for victory might arise!
