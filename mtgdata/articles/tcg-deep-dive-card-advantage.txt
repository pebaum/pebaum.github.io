============================================================

Card advantage, at its core, is the ability to get value from your plays. While drawing cards is important, the concept expands to more than just getting an extra card - it boils down to card quality and making sure each play is meaningful. With this Deep Dive, I'll showcase all the different ways you can achieve card advantage and how you can optimize card advantage, even in ways that may not seem obvious.

The most basic card advantage play is simple: drawing two cards for the price of one with, say, Field Research.

However, card advantage isn't just drawing cards, but trading your cards for more than one card. In my mind, the most basic example of this would be casting Wrath of God against a full board as a control deck. You're "drawing" multiple cards if your opponent is suddenly short two to four creatures due to your one card.

In short, card advantage is anything that creates a net-positive on cards. Field Research trades a card in hand for two cards from your deck while Wrath of God can trade itself for several of your opponent's creatures. If you can refer to your play as getting an "X-for-one" (and X isn't one), then you just made a card advantageous play.

However, the tricky part about card advantage is knowing when to leverage it. Spending the whole game drawing cards is only useful if you can actually deploy them. For example, casting the Field Research in Zendikar Rising Limited isn't always correct on turn three. Sometimes, you just need to play a creature to trade with what's on board and make sure you're not overrun.

Now, this play isn't exactly card advantage, but rather a path to creating future advantage. By playing a creature to stem some of the on-board bleeding, you're making sure you can capitalize on the cards you can be getting in the future. Prioritizing card advantage over focusing on the board is a common mistake that most Magic players make - y our cards in hand are only useful if you're alive to play them.

In my opinion, there are two major level up moments in a Magic player's career. The first is when you start realizing why chumpblocking at 20 life is wrong. The second one is realizing why you have to play something like Ardent Electromancer on turn three to trade with your opponent's creature rather than casting Field Research.

On the other hand, card disadvantage is anything that puts you down a card without trading for other resources. For example, chumpblocking with your creature to prevent a few damage from getting through, bouncing a spell or a creature with an unkicked Into the Roil or spending two Lightning Strike to kill an Elder Gargaroth means you're going down a card and there's no way to recoup that.

All the scenarios I highlighted above are common situations that happen often. Once you make a disadvantageous play, you know and feel that you went down a card. Sometimes, these plays are necessary, but you have to understand whether those plays actually result in a game-winning play or if they're mistakes.

For example, it's right to take down a Gargaroth with two burn spells if you're losing to that Gargaroth. It's also worth noting that the Gargaroth can generate some card advantage for the opponent, so you have to leverage how much you'll be losing to how much they can potentially gain. On the other hand, it's certainly wrong to bounce the opponent's Gnarlid Colony on turn two with an Into the Roil because the opponent can eventually redeploy their creature while you'll always be down a card from that interaction. In essence, you threw away a card and didn't even trade for a card, only time.

Going back to the "X-for-one" analogy, a play that puts you down card advantage puts you on the other end of this equation, giving your opponent the "X-for-one."

However, card disadvantage is more than just trading multiple cards down for a single card. It also comes in the form of raw card quality, which I'll be exploring later in this article. Without spoiling the whole article for you, if you're flooding out by drawing too many lands or playing meaningless or low-impact cards in a matchup, you're generating your own card disadvantage.

Mulliganing is the most basic form of card disadvantage, albeit a necessary choice you may have to make to ensure you can actually play the game.

Mulligans and card advantage are completely different animals between Constructed and Limited. In Constructed, you should be more liberal in mulliganing to deny your opponents the potential of getting "card advantage," whereas in Limited I tend to keep as long as the hand is functionable.

In Limited, mulliganing usually means you have to keep almost every hand with two different colors of mana and up to five lands. Personally, I'm obsessed with card advantage, to the point that I can rarely bear the downside of taking a mulligan where that card loss may never be recouped.

Of course in Constructed, it's a totally different argument, since you're able to get card advantage back in several different ways or you have to respond quickly to the opponent's threats.

Let's take this hand for example, which I found myself staring down at the most recent Zendikar Rising Championship against Gruul Adventures on the draw. It was lacking a two drop and the three drop wasn't stellar either. Despite the fact that this hand had several good four drops in the matchup, I ended up dying before I could deploy them all. If you're wondering, I still got third place though!

After showing this hand to my teammate, Tian Fa Mun, he agreed that I should have mulliganed on the draw, since it needed to be able to interact with the opponent more than just playing an Omen of the Sun on turn three.

In this instance, you could say that the opponent developed card advantage since I didn't mulligan aggressively enough to be able to deploy my cards and answer their game plan. On the other side, my opponent was able to capitalize on their cards with very little in the way to stop them and every play ended up being meaningful.

Mulliganing is of course a very complex topic, one that I could do a whole Deep Dive on. Fortunately, the one and only Reid Duke did his own, with part one and part two available. They're both worth a read if you want to get into the nitty gritty of mulliganing and its own impact on card advantage.

Whenever I put Grafidgger's Cage in my sideboard in Historic, my Twitch chat always wants me to sideboard it in, even if the opponent has very few graveyard synergies. Often times, they're suggesting the Cage against Historic Sultai, which only has Uro, Titan of Nature's Wrath that will be affected by it.

The reason why cards like Grafdigger's Cage aren't good against Sultai in Historic is because you'll have to spend mana and a card on a half-baked answer for one of your opponent's cards. Your opponent meanwhile gets to deploy their game plan and can still cantrip, put a land into play and gain three life off of Uro. Grafdigger's Cage in this scenario isn't even providing a one-for-one trade; it's more like trading your card for half of an Uro.

In some strategies like Azorius Control, playing Grafdigger's Cage to stop Uro from escaping is necessary. Uro can be a huge issue for slow decks where the game will be going long. In the end, they may end up trading multiple cards for multiple returned Uros, while Grafidgger's Cage saves you those removal spells in the long run. Conversely, in aggro decks like Mono Red, you can't possibly spend a card and a mana to put something like Grafdigger's Cage in play in those matchups.

Same thing goes for Authority of the Consuls, whose only value will be to provide some life gain against the aggressive decks. If you want to bring these cards in, you have to ask yourself: do I want to trade one card some life? If the answer is yes, then go ahead and bring Authority of the Consuls in against Mono Red Aggro and Goblins. There, the five life and the speedbump is invaluable. Against a midrange deck though, where your life total won't be relevant, drawing and playing an Authority of the Consuls is just as useful as discarding a card for no value.

Remember that life gain, much like milling the opponent, is often a net zero-sum play in terms of card advantage. A card like is as close you get to card disadvantage unless your deck strategy heavily relies around milling your opponent's whole deck.

On that note, there's another interesting card I want to highlight: Scavenging Ooze.

Scavenging Ooze was featured in most of the Sultai sideboards in both Standard and Historic, mainly as an answer against aggressive decks or Cauldron Familiar decks. Once again though, whenever my Sultai deck was facing an Uro, my Twitch chat was asking me why I wasn't bringing the Ooze in. The reason is, once again, that I didn't want to play card disadvantageous cards.

The post-sideboard Sultai mirror match is about Hydroid Krasis and Shark Typhoon , and casting Scavenging Ooze is basically akin to casting a Grizzly Bears . Sure, you might be able to snag an Uro moments before your opponent might be able to escape it, but more often than not, the Scavenging Ooze will trade with a 3/3 land from Nissa, Who Shakes the World or will be ambushed by an instant speed Shark off Shark Typhoon, leaving you behind a card in a matchup where card advantage is all that matters.

The broad concept here is you shouldn't be bringing in Scavenging Ooze (or some of the other cards mentioned) with only their best-case scenario in mind. Rather, you should be thinking about how the card will normally play out in the matchup. If your sideboard card isn't even providing a sure-fire answer to your opponent's game plan or isn't even an effective answer to a problematic card, you're diluting the quality of your deck and setting yourself up for some bad draws.

During some of my recent Arena Cube streams, I had people trying to convince me that Mirari's Wake is a powerful Magic card. That was probably true... in 2002. In modern Magic though, particular in the last year, you can't afford to pay five mana to play an enchantment and get no real bonus the moment it comes into play.

Mirari's Wake is just an example, but the same could be said for Baneslayer Angel , Terror of the Peaks or even Questing Beast . Those cards do seem amazing at first glance, and they surely have some flashy and powerful abilities, but don't won't shine in Standard since you need your cards to produce a real advantage the moment they touch the ground.

For example, the only deck that plays Terror the Peaks in Standard is trying to cheat it into play with Genesis Ultimatum to kill the opponent with a flurry of triggers from other creatures. Additionally, Questing Beast is only good when it kills a planeswalker and deals four damage to face the same turn it comes into play.

Compare these cards to something like Uro or Omnath, Locus of Creation . Both of these menaces of Standard immediately replace themselves when they come into play and then provide continual advantage as the game goes on. Uro makes continual use of your graveyard, drawing cards and ramping you while providing a resilient threat. Omnath gives you a stream of life and mana to ensure you can capitalize on your card advantage. While these cards are extreme examples (and both are currently banned), you could easily look at a Standard deck from 10 years ago and compare it to today's Standard decks and see noticeable differences in card quality.

To bring another example from Arena Cube, you'll rarely see me picking Nighthawk Scavenger over Alirios. Enraptured . While the Nighthawk has stronger stats, it'll just be easily answered. On the other hand, Alirios will gain actual card advantage by making an extra 2/3 immediately that will add up against a red aggressive deck.

Simply put, removal nowadays is efficient enough and other creatures are so powerful that the bar for what you play needs to be higher. You can't just play a powerful card like Baneslayer Angel, which was an all-star back in its original printing, only to have it get answered by your opponent without achieving anything for you.

Remember, drawing cards is only as useful as your ability to deploy them and your ability to make them useful. Much like bringing in a Grafdigger's Cage in a matchup where it's mediocre, playing lackluster cards that don't immediately generate value gives you the same effect.

In formats like Legacy and Pauper, where you're able to play top-tier cantrips like Ponder, Brainstorm and Preordain, you're able to cheat on lands. You don't need to rely on your draw step to hit your land drops - these cantrips will help you find the needed land drops instead. Alternatively, when you have as many lands as you need, these cantrips switch to digging for the cards you actually need.

One of the ways Temur Delver can beat Snowko in Legacy is by playing only 19 lands, even boarding out three of the four Wastelands to go down to 16. Doing so ensures that, in the late game, they'll draw about four lands and then just spells, whereas the Snowko deck will flood. As a result, you're getting card advantage, since extra lands are redundant compared to your opponent drawing duds as the game goes on.

This is a concept that can be applied to Limited as well. Drafting an aggressive deck with 15 lands means that whenever you play against decks with 17 to 18 lands, you'll be less likely to flood out and will have a higher percentage of spells to cast. Of course, you need to make sure you can deploy your threats off of fewer lands, but Delver has to do the same in Legacy as well.

In particular, Zendikar Rising has brought this concept to a whole other level with the modal dual faced cards, or MDFCs for short.

These new additions to the game can be played as either a spell or a land, giving you value out of your land slots. In my draft deck for the hand above, I only had 10 basic lands with six MDFCs and three Reclaim the Wastes . As a result, I was basically never ever having issues with flooding and I always had something to do at every point of the curve. Just look at this hand - it basically has five lands and no lands at the same time!

Magic is always finding new ways to avoid mana flood and ways to make mana useful. As a player, you should always try to exploit these new ways, especially in Limited where drawing a seventh or eighth land often means that your draws are turning into card disadvantage.

In Constructed, this isn't quite the same. Decks like Sultai Midrange in Historic love to play extra lands thanks to Hydroid Krasis and Shark Typhoon wanting you to hit your first six to eight land drops. As a result, you're not holding your Zagoth Triome to cycle often and you're instead looking for other ways to gain card advantage. Basically, most Constructed decks can capitalize on having a lot of extra mana whereas Limited decks can't.

Time's have changed though and in it's easy to find outlets for your mana. The concept of flooding today only applies to aggro decks or to a small percentage of games for other decks.

The key takeaways here are that card advantage is just as much as about quality as it is about quantity .

In one way, card advantage is trading your Field Research for two more cards. In a broader sense, it's about making sure that the cards you draw are meaningful. Additionally, netting card advantage is just as dependent on the deck's pilot as it is on the card. Making sure you cast card advantageous cards at the correct time, avoiding two-for-ones (if possible) and not falling for bad sideboarding is just as crucial as drawing extra cards.

As a general rule and takeaway, don't get greedy by prioritizing card advantage over developing your game plan. Make sure your card quality is consistent and high and try to make every card you draw as meaningful as possible.
