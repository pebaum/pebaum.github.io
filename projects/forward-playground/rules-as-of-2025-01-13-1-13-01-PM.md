### Beasts
- Standard combat encounter
- HP varies by tier

### Hollow
- Boss encounter (always in last 3 cards of deck)
- Longer fight than Beasts
- No special reward after defeating

### Terror
- **Choice:** Lose 4 HP OR lose 1 Lux
- AI logic: Spend Lux if HP < 12, else take 4 HP

### Pit
- Roll d6 until 3 successes or 3 failures
- **Success:** Roll 3+ on d6
- **Failure:** Roll 1-2 on d6, take 1 HP damage

## Lux System

### Lux Uses (requires Empty Prism)

2. **Reroll:** Spend 1 Lux to reroll 1 die in combat
3. **Peek:** Spend 1 Lux to flip 2 of 3 drawn cards face-up, shuffle up to 2 back into deck

### AI Lux Logic
- **Heal:** When HP < 12 and not snared
- **Peek:** When HP 8-14 AND Lux ≥ 2
- **Reroll:** Emergency only (would die otherwise)

## Location Progression

## Balance Assessment

### Strengths
- Smooth Tier 1 progression (98%+ clear rate)
- Equipment scaling is effective
- Predictable boss positioning allows strategy
- Full heals prevent death spiral between locations

### Known Issues
- Location 7 death wall (12.9% of deaths)
- Location 4 has sharp difficulty spike
- Weapon draw RNG impacts clear rate (±10%)
- Terror choice lacks depth

### Luck vs Skill Split
- **Current:** 60% Luck / 40% Skill
- **With human play:** 50% Luck / 50% Skill
- **Expected human win rate:** 50-55% (vs AI 41%)

## Design Goals
- Challenging but fair roguelike experience
- Equipment progression feels meaningful
- Late game provides real challenge
- Accessible early game (doesn't gatekeep new players)
