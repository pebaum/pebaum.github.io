## Playtest Questions to Answer

After your playthrough, consider:

1. Did you survive? If yes, with how much HP?
2. Did you find the Snare early or late? How much did it hurt?
3. Which Equipment did you find first? Did you use both slots?
4. How did you spend your Lux? (all healing? mix of healing/rerolls?)
5. What was your Terror choice? (HP or discard Item?)
6. How many Pit failures did you get? (1-2 per Pit is expected)
7. Did any 7 HP enemy feel too long to fight?
8. Were there moments of meaningful choice?
9. Were there moments of frustration?
10. What would you change?

## Expected Outcomes

**Good play:** End with 9-12 HP
**Perfect play:** End with 14-16 HP
**Bad luck/choices:** End with 2-5 HP or death

If you're consistently ending above 15 HP, the game is too easy.
If you're consistently dying, the game is too hard.
