FORWARD — RULES v1.1 (ALPHA)

OBJECTIVE
- Defeat the Dragon of Chaos at the bottom of the deck.
- You lose if your HP reaches 0.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1) COMPONENTS
- Forward deck (100 cards), containing:
  • Player
  • Dragon of Chaos
  • Ghostly Princess
  • Mirror Knight
  • 9 Location cards (each has a unique layout + a persistent effect)
  • 81 location-associated cards (9 per location):
    - Scene, Item, Equipment, Humanoid (Hollow), Beast, Snare, Pit, Terror, Blessing
- 1 six-sided die (d6)
- XP pile area

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
2) SETUP
1. Remove from deck:
   - Player (place in front of you)
   - Dragon of Chaos (set aside for endgame)
   - Mirror Knight (set aside to insert mid-deck)
   - Ghostly Princess (set aside to shuffle in)
   - Spare cards (set aside; not used)
2. Shuffle the 9 Location cards into their own face-down pile.
3. Shuffle the main deck (everything except Dragon).
4. Insert Mirror Knight roughly halfway into the main deck.
5. Shuffle Ghostly Princess into the main deck at random.
6. Place Dragon of Chaos on the bottom of the main deck.
7. Starting stats: HP = 20, Max HP = 20, XP = 0.
8. Inventory limits: Items 0/2, Equipment 0/2.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
3) PLAYING THE GAME

A) LOCATION PHASE (per location)
1. Draw the top Location card; its layout/effect apply while you are here.
2. Deal the top 9 cards of the main deck face-down onto the layout spaces.
3. Starting tile: choose ANY one of the closest cards per the layout diagram.
4. Movement / adjacency (map turns):
   - A map turn = you choose ONE adjacent face-down card, flip it, and resolve it.
   - Adjacency is orthogonal (↑↓←→). If no orthogonal face-down neighbor exists,
     you may move diagonally (↗↖↘↙) instead.
   - You may revisit resolved tiles freely to reach other cards.
   - Apply any “start of map turn” location effects BEFORE flipping.
5. Farthest row rule:
   - You may stop exploring this location once you have reached ANY card in the
     row (rank) that is farthest from your chosen start tile (per the layout’s geometry).
   - When you stop (or a location forces an end), ALL unrevealed cards here are
     buried under the Dragon.
6. If you clear all 9 cards, put the Location card into your XP pile.

B) REVEAL vs RESOLVE
- Reveal = turn face-up. Resolve = carry out the card’s effect(s) immediately.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
4) CARD TYPES & RESOLUTION

MONSTERS (Hollows & Beasts)
- Fight using the Duel System (Sec. 5).
- On victory, put the defeated monster into your XP pile.

EQUIPMENT
- Max 2 equipped. Equipping beyond the limit: immediately choose one to unequip;
  unequipped equipment goes to XP.
- Equipment is ongoing while equipped unless stated otherwise.

ITEMS
- Max 2 carried. One-time use, then to XP.

TERRORS
- On reveal choose ONE:
  (A) Take the listed HP loss and gain XP (card to XP), OR
  (B) Bury it (no XP).

PITS (TRAPS)
- Roll d6 against the card’s target number (if absent, 4+).
- Fail: take listed HP loss. Succeed: no HP loss.
- Either way, the Pit card goes to XP.

SNARES
- Ongoing penalty until cleansed by a Blessing/effect that says “cleanse”.
- When cleansed, the snare card goes to XP.

BLESSINGS
- Positive effect that lasts until you leave the current location (unless stated).
- If it says “cleanse snare”, remove your current snare(s) as specified; cleansed
  snare cards go to XP.

SCENES
- Resolve their effect (often healing) and put the Scene into XP.

GHOSTLY PRINCESS
- On reveal: place her next to the Player; then flip the TOP card of the deck
  face-down into the now-empty map space.
- If you give her the Gilded Bangle, she becomes activated (the Bangle leaves
  your slots and goes to her).
- If activated, on reaching the Dragon she sacrifices to remove the Dragon’s
  invulnerability shield.

SAGE
- On reveal: place him next to the Player; then flip the TOP card of the deck
  face-down into the now-empty map space.
- If you give him the Ferryman’s Bell, he becomes activated (the Bell leaves
  your slots and goes to him).
- If activated, on reaching the Dragon he sacrifices to halve the Dragon’s
  current HP (round up).

MIRROR KNIGHT
- On reveal: fight immediately (Duel System).
- It is an exact copy of the Player at the moment combat starts:
  • Copies your current HP, ATK, DEF, and ongoing modifiers (blessings, location effects,
    Moonleaf Brandy if already consumed this fight).
  • Does NOT copy your items (no Phoenix Tear or Mirror Shard in hand).
- After the battle, replace it: flip the TOP card of the deck face-down into that space.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
5) COMBAT — DUEL SYSTEM

ROUND SEQUENCE (simultaneous resolution)
1) Both sides roll 1d6.
2) Translate each roll to a base result:
   - 1 = Miss            (deal 0 this round)
   - 2 = Parry           (block all damage you would take this round)
   - 3 = Hit             (1 base damage)
   - 4 = Hit             (1 base damage)
   - 5 = Critical        (2 base damage)
   - 6 = Counter         (block all incoming damage AND deal 1 damage;
                          if both roll 6, both block and neither deals the counter damage)
3) Add Player stats to damage dealt:
   - When YOU deal damage (Hit/Crit/Counter), add +ATK to your damage.
4) Compute both sides’ total damage for the round (including effects like
   Moonleaf Brandy’s +1 this combat, snare/blessing/location modifiers).
5) Apply defense to incoming damage:
   - Reduce damage YOU take by your DEF (to a minimum of 0).
   - Enemies normally have no DEF unless a card states otherwise.
6) Apply HP loss. If either side reaches 0 HP, the fight ends.

COMMON EFFECT CALL-OUTS
- “Miss first attack(s)” snares: your first 1 or 2 combat rolls are treated as 1 (Miss)
  and still count as “you rolled a 1” for effects.
- Brume snare (first attack against you deals double damage): the first damaging hit
  you take after this applies is ×2, then reduce by DEF.
- Frozen Gaol blessing (“normal hit on 1”): your 1 counts as a normal Hit (1 base damage).
- Mirrored Shield (“block on 1–2”): whenever you would take damage, roll 1d6; on 1–2,
  set that single instance of incoming damage to 0 (after DEF).

LOCATION COMBAT MODIFIERS
- Caelith Spiremaze — Perilous Climb: whenever YOU roll a 1 in combat, you take +1
  damage (this extra damage is reduced by DEF).
- Frozen Gaol — Chill to the Bone: your first combat roll of each fight here is at –1
  (to a minimum of 1), applied after other roll modifiers.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6) INVENTORY, LIMITS & TIMING
- Item limit 2; Equipment limit 2. On pickup beyond a limit, immediately choose and
  discard to XP until within limits.
- Using items (unless timing is specified):
  • You may use an item on your map turn or at the start of a combat round before rolling.
  • Phoenix Tear: when you would hit 0 HP, instead heal 10; then to XP.
  • Moonleaf Brandy: at start of a fight, lose 4 HP; your hits/counters deal +1 damage
    this combat.
  • Mirror Shard: on your turn during combat, deal 2 true damage (not modified by ATK;
    enemies typically have no DEF).
- Giving items to companions (Princess/Sage): you must own the item (equipped or carried);
  giving it removes it from your slots and activates the companion.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
7) XP & MAX HP GROWTH
- Each card placed into your XP pile = +1 Max HP (does not heal current HP).
- You gain XP from:
  • Defeated monsters
  • Resolved dangers (Pits, Terrors if you take the HP loss, Snares when cleared)
  • Used items
  • Unequipped equipment (when swapped out)
  • Completed Location cards
  • Scenes (when resolved)

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
8) ENDGAME — DRAGON OF CHAOS
- After finishing the 9th location, fight the Dragon using the Duel System.
- Dragon HP = 40 + 1 for EACH card beneath it, where “beneath” includes:
  • All unrevealed cards left behind when you stopped at a location’s farthest row.
  • Every buried card (from any effect or choice).
- The Dragon has an invulnerability shield:
  • If the Ghostly Princess was activated, she sacrifices on arrival to remove the shield.
- The Ancient Sword is the ONLY thing that can damage the Dragon; without it (or if not
  equipped), your attacks deal 0.
- If the Sage was activated, he sacrifices on arrival to halve the Dragon’s current HP
  (round up).
- Win if you reduce the Dragon to 0 HP; lose if your HP reaches 0.
