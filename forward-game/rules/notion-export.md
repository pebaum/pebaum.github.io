NEW RULES

*Forward to the Golden City 
to unseal the light of day*

**I: Contents**

- 200 cards, including:
    - 9 Domain title cards

    - Health Tracker card
    - Turn Summary reference card
    - Blanks/spares (intentionally present in the prototype)
- Dice: Two six-sided dice
- Tokens TO USE ON TRACKER CARDS

**II: Prepare to play**

**Set up play area**

You’ll need an area to play about as deep and wide as your natural arms reach at a table.

Separate all the cards and set them in their proper places. 

**Left: World Map**
*Arranged like a diamond*

- Separate out the the nine Domain decks (they share a back) and arrange them in a diamond with the Title card on top, and the face down domain cards beneath (you’ll shuffle them later)
- The Nightsea Expanse
- Amara Rot Glade | Frozen Gaol
- Caelith Spiremaze | Sirocco Wastes | Darkwood Brume
- Forgotten Shrine | Bannered City Valthria
- Home Villiage Termina

**Middle: Exploration**
*Arranged like a pyramid, but empty for now…*

- At the top: Domain title card (landscape)
- Middle row: Draw pile, discard pile (empty)
- Bottom row: 3 face down domain cards from the draw pile

**Right: Status**

- At the top: Player Card
- Beneath, in a row: Tracker cards
    - Health (set to 20)
    - Grace (set to 0)
    - Resolve (set to 0)
    - Status (set to none)
- You’ll also use this space for two Item card slots; two Equipment card slots; any persistent Snares; and space to stack completed Domains - more on that later.

**III: Starting your adventure**

- Begin at the first Domain at the bottom (“Home Village Termina”). Pick it up and move that stack to the center.
- Lift the title card, shuffle the face-down Domain deck without looking and place it underneath the title card. Make space next to the Draw pile for a Discard pile
- Draw 3 face down cards from the discard pile and arrange them in a row of 3 beneath the draw and discard piles, resembling a pyramid:
    - Domain title card
    - Draw pile | Discard pile
    - Card 1 | Card 2 | Card 3

**IV: Exploring a Domain**

1. Draw three cards from the Domain deck face down into slots 1–3 beneath the title card.
2. Choose any one slot to reveal first. Resolve it fully (see Card Types).
3. Place resolved cards as instructed (typically to that Domain’s discard pile).
4. Immediately refill the emptied slot with the next face-down card from the deck.
5. Keep three face-down choices visible at all times unless the deck is empty. If the deck runs out while refilling, continue with the remaining slots until all cards have been revealed once.
6. No peeking/reordering the face-down slots unless a card effect or Item/Equipment explicitly allows it.
7. Continue until the Domain deck is completed.
8. Take all cards in the discard pile are out of position, and you then in the box are out of play. 

**V: Stations of the Path**

1. Item
    - Goes to your Item slots (max 2). If full, you may swap; the replaced Item goes to this Domain’s discard.
    - Use at any time; once used, move to this Domain’s discard.
2. Equipment
    - Go to your Equipment slots (max 2). If full, you may swap; the replaced Equipment goes to this Domain’s discard.
    - Use at any time per card text.
3. Duel
    - Roll simultaneous 2d6 (one for you, one for foe) each exchange.
    - Both sides apply Combat Table effects simultaneously.
    - On victory, send the foe to discard and apply any additional effects.
4. Confrontation
    - Roll simultaneous 2d6 (one for you, one for foe) each exchange.
    - Both sides apply Combat Table effects simultaneously.
    - On victory, send the foe to discard and apply any additional effects.
5. Terror
    - Presents two effects; choose one, resolve it, then discard.
6. Pit
    - Trap/skill test vs. a target number using d6.
    - Some pits are single-roll; others require 3 successes before 3 failures. Tally successes/failures until one threshold is met; then resolve and discard.
7. Snare
    - A persistent effect; place the card in your player area. It remains until a card effect removes it.
8. Caesura
    - No effect; proceed and discard.
9. Blessing
    - Immediate effect; resolve, then discard.
10. Rest
    - Spend 1 Resolve to gain 1 Grace
    - Spend 1 Resolve to heal 5 Health

**VI: Forward**

1. When you leave Termina, and you are faced with the choice of two Domains to explore: The Forgotten Shrine, and The Bannered City Valthria
2. You may select Domains that are adjacent to one you just completed, but you may never move backwards. 
3. Select your Domain and set it up just as you did in step 3. 
4. Continue forward Domain to Domain until you complete the Nightsea Expanse. 

**VII: The Final Battle**

1. After crossing the Nightsea, place the Guardian in front of you and face your final trial. 

**VIII: Failure**

1. If at any time you give up, your dread is 4, or your health is reduced to 0 - you die. Reset the game completely and move Forward.

to unseal the light of day.

RULES (Prototype)

I. Contents
Components in this prototype:
- 200 cards total:
  - 9 Domain Title cards
  - 162 Station cards (18 per Domain)
  - 1 Player card
  - 1 Guardian card (final battle)
  - 1 Resolve & Dread tracker (slider -4 … 0 … +4) (represented in prototype by a card + token)
  - 1 Grace tracker (0–3)
  - 1 Health tracker (start 20)
  - 1 Turn / Combat reference (table)
  - Status reference (use spare card + tokens for poison, etc.)
  - Several blank/spare cards
- Dice: 2d6
- Tokens/markers for: Health (if desired), Resolve/Dread slider, Grace (single token moves among 0–3), Status effects, and any persistent Snares.

II. Setup
Lay out three zones:
1. World Map (Left): Arrange the 9 Domain Title cards in a rough path/diamond. Bottom start: Home Village Termina. Top: The Nightsea Expanse. (Exact geometry is only thematic.)
2. Exploration Area (Center): Will hold the currently active Domain: Title card on top; beneath it the Domain draw pile (face down) and a discard pile (starts empty); below those, a row of up to three facedown Station cards (slots 1–3) drawn from that Domain.
3. Status / Player Area (Right): Place Player card and trackers (Health 20, Resolve 0, Grace 0, Dread neutral at 0). Leave space for: 2 Item slots, 2 Equipment slots, any persistent Snares, and a stack where completed Domain Title cards will accumulate.

Prepare the first Domain:
- Take Home Village Termina: separate its 18 Station cards, shuffle them face down under its Title card (don’t look), and place that stack into the Exploration Area.
- Draw 3 cards from its deck face down into slots 1–3 forming a row under the Title/draw/discard.

III. Starting Your Adventure
You begin in Home Village Termina. Resolve that Domain completely before moving forward.
Each time you reveal a Station card, follow the resolution rules (Section V). Keep three face-down choices (slots) in front of you until the Domain deck is exhausted.

IV. Exploring a Domain (Turn Loop)
1. Ensure there are 3 facedown Station cards (slots 1–3). If fewer, immediately draw from that Domain deck to refill until either 3 are present or the deck is empty.
2. Choose one slot and flip that card face up.
3. Resolve it fully (see Station Card Types, Section V); most go to that Domain’s discard afterward.
4. If the Domain deck still has cards, immediately refill that empty slot with the next facedown card (maintain 3 choices whenever possible).
5. No peeking/rearranging facedown cards unless an effect explicitly allows it.
6. Continue until the Domain deck is empty AND all facedown cards have been revealed and resolved.
7. Domain Completion: Remove every card from that Domain (including its discard pile) from the game; stack the Domain Title in your Completed pile (right area). These cards do not return later.

V. Station Card Types
When a Station card is revealed, resolve the type below then discard it unless stated otherwise.
1. Item – Place in one of your two Item slots (max 2). If both full you may immediately swap; the displaced Item is discarded to this Domain’s discard pile. Items may have a one-time “Use:” line; when used, discard the Item.
2. Equipment – Place in one of your two Equipment slots (max 2). If full you may swap as with Items. Equipment remains unless a card effect removes it.
3. Duel – A foe or obstacle fought via simultaneous combat. Roll two d6 each exchange (one for you, one for the foe). Apply the Combat Table (reference card) results simultaneously. Repeat until one side’s HP (or condition) is satisfied; on victory discard the foe and apply any reward/effect on the card.
4. Terror – Presents two choices. Pick one option, resolve it, discard the card.
5. Pit – A trap/test. Either a single roll vs. target, or an extended test needing 3 Successes before 3 Failures. Track tallies; once one threshold is reached, resolve the outcome then discard.
6. Snare – Persistent hazard/status. Place it near your Player card; it remains affecting you until an effect removes it. Then discard it.
7. Caesura – Empty moment. No effect; discard.
8. Blessing – Immediate beneficial effect; resolve then discard.
9. Rest – A respite. You may, any number of times while resolving this Rest card: Spend 1 Resolve to gain 1 Grace OR Spend 1 Resolve to heal 5 Health. (You may mix these.) After you finish spending, discard the Rest.

VI. Forward (Path Progression)
After completing Home Village Termina you choose an adjacent forward Domain (e.g., Forgotten Shrine or Bannered City Valthria). You may only select Domains that lie “ahead” (adjacent upward/forward in your notional path). You cannot backtrack to already completed Domains or bypass gaps laterally that are not adjacent. Continue choosing and completing Domains in a forward chain until you reach and complete the Nightsea Expanse. The specific path you take will influence your prospects in the Final Battle. Some items, encounters, or companions may appear purposeless when found.

VII. The Final Battle (Guardian)
After your eighth Domain is completed and the Nightsea Expanse stands cleared, confront the Guardian. Read the Guardian card carefully; it will specify conditions that must be satisfied (seals, prerequisites, vulnerabilities) before victory is possible. Combat with the Guardian follows the same simultaneous 2d6 procedure as Duels, using the Guardian’s unique combat table. If the Guardian’s listed requirements cannot be met, the battle may be unwinnable on this run.

VIII. Grace
Grace represents providence and second chances.
- Track 0–3 (never exceed 3).
- Start the game with 0 Grace.
- Gain Grace only by spending Resolve at Rest cards (1 Resolve -> 1 Grace each time).
- Spend 1 Grace at any time to reroll any single die you just rolled or an enemy just rolled (before applying its effects). You must keep the new result.
- Grace may be used in Duels, Pits, or any other roll context.
- Spent Grace is removed (adjust tracker).

IX. Failure
You lose immediately if:
- Your Health is reduced to 0.
- Your Dread track would move beyond -4 (or other lethal condition a future rule may define).
- You abandon the journey (voluntary forfeit).

FORWARD — Official Rules (v0.3)
Clean draft based on Sept 16, 2025 transcript + clarifications

MISSING SOMETHING ABOUT RESOLVE, STATUS, GRACE, ETC

============================================================
13) TURN SUMMARY (REFERENCE)
============================================================
1) If needed, refill the row to three face-down cards.
2) Choose any slot → flip → resolve per card type.
3) Place resolved card where instructed (discard; player area for Snares; inventory/equipment if taken).
4) Refill the empty slot from the Domain deck.
5) Anytime windows: Use Items/Equipment (no timing restriction), spend Grace for rerolls at eligible moments, apply/track Status effects.
6) When the Domain deck is exhausted, complete the Domain (stack discard + title card on right) and move along a legal arrow to the next Domain.

============================================================
14) GLOSSARY
============================================================
• Caesera (“pause”): A no-effect exploration beat; reveal and discard. (Working spelling in this draft.)
• Grace: Banked reroll purchased at Rest for 1 Resolve; cap 0–3. Spend later to reroll a single die (may chain on the same roll).
• Row of Three: The three face-down Station choices; always maintain three if possible.
• Snare: A persistent hindrance that remains in your player area until another effect removes it.

============================================================
15) OPEN ITEMS (FOR PRODUCTION)
============================================================
1) Rules/Combat reference counts: finalize quantities (and which blanks will be used).
2) Guardian reveal: define any setup modifiers to print on the Guardian card (pre-placed Snares, Dread spikes, arena rules, etc.).
3) Peeking permissions: keep “no peeking unless a card says so,” or add a universal ability (e.g., pay Resolve to peek one slot)?
4) World-map graphic: approve ASCII for now; commission a full-page diagram with arrows and example pathing for the print rules.

# FORWARD — RULES v2.1 (Diamond Path Edition)

A solo roguelike card adventure about choosing what you’ll face and what you’ll leave behind.

================================================================================
0) OVERVIEW & OBJECTIVE
================================================================================
The world has thinned to nine haunted places. Your father—the Mirror Knight—
challenged the Dragon of Chaos and failed. You will cross each place in turn,
gather what you can, and finally confront the Dragon.

You win if you defeat the Dragon after completing the 9th Domain.
You lose if your HP reaches 0 (or a card effect ends the game).

================================================================================
1) CONTENTS
================================================================================
• Forward Deck (100+ total): 9 Domain cards and their Station cards
  (items, equipment, allies, scenes, hazards, combats, etc.).
• Resolve card and Dread card (used together as the Resolve/Dread Track).
• Player card, markers/tokens, and any reference cards.
• No BURIED pile: when a card instructs you to bury, gain 1 Dread instead.

================================================================================
2) QUICKSTART (TEACH BOX)
================================================================================
1. Lay out the Diamond Path of nine Domain stacks (Fig. 1).
2. Build the Resolve/Dread Track with a marker in the neutral gap.
3. Take Domain L1 into play (Fig. 2). Draw 3 cards face-down to the Active row.
4. On your turn, reveal and resolve one Active card (your choice).
   • Keepers (items/equipment/companions/boons) go to your Player Zone.
   • Others go to the Discard; if instructed to bury, gain 1 Dread instead.
   • Refill the Active row back to 3 while the deck has cards.
5. When the deck and Active row are empty, cap the discard with the Domain card
   and set that stack aside, out of play.
6. Choose the next Domain from the Diamond and repeat until you face the Dragon.

================================================================================
3) TABLE LAYOUT & FLOW
================================================================================
3.1 FIG. 1 — Diamond Path (nine Domain stacks)

                [L9]
            [L7]   [L8]
        [L4]   [L5]   [L6]
            [L2]   [L3]
                [L1]

• Each [L#] is a Domain stack: face-up Domain card on top; that Domain’s
  shuffled, face-down deck underneath it.
• The labels L1 → L9 show the order you plan to tackle them (e.g., L1 = Home Village Termina).
• A Domain stack always travels together.

3.2 Resolve / Dread Track (two-card slider)
• Place Resolve on top of Dread, offset so a slim neutral gap is visible between
  them. Put one marker in the neutral gap to start.
• Each card shows 4 steps/bands.
• Gain N Resolve → move the marker up N steps toward the Resolve card.
• Gain N Dread   → move the marker down N steps toward the Dread card.
• The marker is capped at the ends (cannot go beyond the 4th band).
• Cards may check thresholds like “if Resolve ≥ 2” or “if Dread ≥ 3.”
  Count steps outward from the neutral gap.
• The track persists between Domains unless a card says otherwise.

3.3 FIG. 2 — Active Domain (play space for the chosen stack)

[Active Domain card]     ← face-up reference/title/art

[Domain Deck ↓]   [Discard]     ← deck face-down; discard starts empty

Active row (face-down, up to three):
[?]   [?]   [?]

================================================================================
4) SETUP
================================================================================
1) Select the nine Domains for this run and arrange them as the Diamond Path.
2) For each Domain: Domain card face-up, its own shuffled deck face-down under it.
3) Set your Player Zone nearby (HP marker, inventory limits, companions, etc.).
4) Place Resolve over Dread to form the Track; start with the marker in the neutral gap.

================================================================================
5) Domain SEQUENCE & TURN STRUCTURE
================================================================================
5.1 Begin a Domain
• Remove the chosen Domain stack (e.g., L1) from the Diamond and build the
  Active Domain area (Fig. 2).
• Draw three cards face-down into the Active row.

5.2 Your Turn (inside a Domain)
On your turn, perform the following; if a card contradicts these rules, follow the card.
1) Choose one face-down Active card. Reveal it.
2) Resolve its text completely.
   – If it stays with you (Item/Equipment/Companion/Boon), place it in your Player Zone
     (respect limits printed on your Player card or the card itself).
   – If it's a Snare, leave it in your Player Zone or a dedicated Snare area (see 9.1). It remains until cleansed or otherwise removed.
   – If it does not stay, place it on the Discard.
   – If it says bury, gain 1 Dread instead (discard it unless otherwise stated).
   – If it references Resolve/Dread, move your marker accordingly.
3) Refill the Active row back to three face-down cards if the deck still has cards.
4) Effects may let you peek, reorder, scry, fish, or otherwise manipulate the deck or row.

Rules notes
• “Active cards” are only the face-down cards in the row. Once revealed and resolved,
  they move to your Player Zone or the Discard as instructed; bury effects instead
  cause you to gain 1 Dread.
• If a draw/refill step is required but the deck is empty, skip that step.

5.3 Finishing a Domain
• When both the Domain deck is empty and the Active row has no cards left:
  1) Place the Domain card on top of the Discard pile (capping it).
  2) Move the capped stack aside, out of play.
  3) Choose your next Domain from the Diamond and rebuild the Active Domain area.

================================================================================
6) CARD TYPES (REFERENCE)
================================================================================
• Item / Equipment / Boon — Kept in your Player Zone; may grant stats, uses, or text effects.
• Companion / Ally — Kept in your Player Zone; abilities or single-use powers.
• Scene / Rest — Immediate effects; usually go to Discard after resolving.
• Hazard / Pit / Snare / Challenge — Tests that can cost HP, cards, Resolve, time, etc. Revealed Snares stay in your Player Zone until cleansed (see 9.1).
• Combat / Beast / Hollow — Fights using the Duel System (Section 7).
• Treasure / Reward / Blessing — Immediate benefits or persistent keepers.
• Terror — Hard choices or escalating pressure (often interacts with Dread).
• Caesura — Moments of exploration or calm. When revealed, read any brief text and discard. They have no major mechanics and never grant keepers, start duels, or force tests. At most they may let you peek at or reorder nearby cards or regain 1 HP or Resolve.
• Bury — Gain 1 Dread instead; discard the card unless told otherwise.

If a card’s type and its rules ever disagree, the rules text wins.

================================================================================
7) DUEL SYSTEM (COMBAT)
================================================================================
When you enter Combat, both you and the enemy roll 1d6 simultaneously and apply results.
Reduce damage you take by your [DEF]. Add [ATK] to your damage where noted.

Player faces
1 — MISS: Deal 0.
2 — PARRY: Block all incoming.
3 — HIT: Deal 1 + [ATK].
4 — HIT: Deal 1 + [ATK].
5 — CRITICAL: Deal 2 + [ATK].
6 — COUNTER: Block all incoming and deal 1 (unless enemy text overrides).

Enemy text defines its HP, faces, immunities, and on-hit effects. Apply all text.
If both sides would block and deal damage, apply blocks first, then any damage that remains.
If either side hits 0 HP, that side is defeated immediately.

================================================================================
8) RESOLVE & DREAD (DETAIL)
================================================================================
Resolve represents courage/clarity/momentum. Dread represents fear/confusion/weight.
• Start with the marker in the neutral gap between the two cards.
• Gain/Spend Resolve or Gain Dread as instructed by cards; move the marker up/down.
• Many cards check thresholds like “if Resolve ≥ 2” or “if Dread ≥ 3.”
• Unless a card says otherwise, your current step on the track persists between Domains.

Designer intent: the Track is a shared scalar resource that cards read from or modify.
High Resolve and high Dread effects live on the cards themselves.

================================================================================
9) PLAYER ZONE & LIMITS
================================================================================
• Keep Items/Equipment/Companions/Boons here.
• If a limit is exceeded, immediately discard down to the limit; if you would have
  buried excess cards, gain 1 Dread for each instead.
• Spent or broken cards will say how and when they leave play.

9.1 Snares
• When revealed, a Snare stays face-up in your Player Zone or a dedicated Snare area until cleansed or otherwise removed.
• Effects that say “Cleanse 1 Snare” let you choose one of your revealed Snares. Discard it and ignore its ongoing effects.

================================================================================
10) RESTS, SCENES, & CHECKPOINTS
================================================================================
Some cards instruct you to rest, recover, or bank progress (heal, reduce Dread,
stash items, etc.). Resolve exactly as written; most go to Discard after use.

================================================================================
11) THE DRAGON OF CHAOS (FINAL FIGHT)
================================================================================
After completing the 9th Domain, assemble the Dragon and follow its card(s):
• Use the Duel System with the Dragon’s special faces and seals/immunities as printed.
• You may carry everything in your Player Zone into the battle unless told otherwise.
• If the Dragon’s HP drops to 0, you win. If your HP reaches 0, you lose.

If your set uses Seals/Boons tied to the Sage, Ghostly Princess, or Mirror Knight,
follow those card rules when instructed.

================================================================================
12) EDGE CASES & PRIORITY
================================================================================
• Card text > This rulebook when they conflict.
• If an instruction can’t be completed, do as much as possible and ignore the rest.
• “Draw” from a Domain means from its face-down Domain deck unless explicitly
  told to draw from elsewhere.
• If a pile is empty when you must draw/refill, skip that step.

================================================================================
13) ASCII REFERENCE (FOR PRINTER-FRIENDLY DIAGRAMS)
