# Artwork Notes

## Style prompt (9.23.25)
We are generating monochrome apparitions: ethereal, spectral, and numinous figures dissolving into void as if glowing through smoke. Use a matte black background with visible paper grain and dust speckle. Portrait aspect (2:3-9:16). Marks can bleed past 8-12% safe margins in faint haze.

- Composition: Center-weighted but loose; vertical flow, drifting wisps, and asymmetry. Figures can feel suspended.
- Palette: Black and white only. Whites are smoky, semi-translucent, and softly glowing. Gradients come from haze and diffusion, not hard fills.
- Medium: Charcoal/pastel on toothy black paper. Pressure variance and smudge should stay visible. Dusty, ghostlike marks.
- Mark-making: Decisive strokes at the core with feathery tendrils and dissipating trails. Roughly 10-20 layered marks. Core crisp, edges dissolving.
- Lighting: Self-emissive glow with generous bloom (20-40px falloff). No external light or cast shadows.
- Depth: Flat iconography softened by atmospheric layering; depth via overlapping opacity.
- Edges: Feather into dust and subtle halos; wisps trail into void. Peripheral flecks may appear.
- Mood: Ethereal, mournful, ceremonial stillness. Presence dissolving into absence.
- Content prompt: Bannered City Valthria.
